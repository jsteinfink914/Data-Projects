Sixers both ends floor Kyrie that second round went against bucks bucks that had best record They just won title Celtics without Kyrie did not play best how can you compare years when they played different teams That's not sweep next time make sure you get right you look little less dumb Celtics with Kyrie lost round bucks bucks that had best record Kyrie was only allstar Celtics Shame that Without Kyrie did Celtics play with best record not then why are you comparing when they didn't play same competition with without him How does that make sense your head You are ignorant context bucks were seed when Celtics beat them When Kyrie played them round they had best record Which means they got lot better That shouldn't rocket science you're judging him off one Your ignorance impressive They won games with Kyrie having those stats Then they lost round bucks bucks that had best record Winning isn't automatic Curry just missed playoffs LeBron just lost first round you're judging Kyrie based one with was traded when was only allstar that that Hayward was coming off terrible injury Tatum his Brown his They lost bucks with best record Celtics did not play with best record without Kyrie They did with Kyrie That context matters cause they didn't play same opponents doesn't matter what they did before they not playing same competition They had winning record with him fool They lost earlier playoffs cause they played with best record bucks Why are you continuing ignorant Celtics were not loaded They were good with Kyrie Who said they sucked Find tweet that says that bet you can't Kyrie was only allstar Celtics going against bucks that had best record Those are facts Not opinion They lost better They looked worst with him based what Did Celtics play bucks when they had best record playoffs with without Kyrie they didn't play them with without Kyrie then why are you comparing when they didn't play same How talking like that Are you just imagining shit your head said Kyrie was only allstar Celtics That's fact said bucks had best record That's fact why are you putting extra shit ain't say know what they did What was point your tweet Did you just want say something that contributes nothing bucks had best record Cavs did not Add something more insightful conversation next time You think based what Embid just lost hawks round least when Kyrie lost round bucks
