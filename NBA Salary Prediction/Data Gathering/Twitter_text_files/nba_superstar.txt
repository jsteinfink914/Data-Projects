@sportsvids1 Oh lord. the man didnt do that deliberately. the reason you cant do all that fancy stuff in a sport is the potential to get hit, or fouled, causing you to lose the ball. NBA, same thing. thats what makes a "superstar" uncommon. They shine despite defense. thats sports

@ESPNNBA @mrvincecarter15 Dude KD is 33, he don't got much time to take over, he might the best player in the league but he will never be the face of the NBA and as soon as lebron retires, it will go to a young superstar like Giannis or Luka whoever breaks out next, Nobody takes over the league at 33.

@ShaunStevensYea My interpretation was that he’s bad, the NBA has created a trickle down situation where even Ben (fake superstar) can try to hold leverage even though he has none. AND he is more concerned with fame than actually being an NBA superstar. OH AND FUCK THIS SHIT.

@CandaceDBuckner NBA is about to ink a $75 billion deal. For that money, they need content 365 days a year. The Simmons narrative carried the NBA through the off season, so he’s by definition a ‘superstar.’ One sportswriter’s opinion of his character is just content and elevates his status.
@Amuel_7 @JoshEberley Winning rings as a role-player isn't nearly as impressive as being an elite superstar in the NBA.
@jelynchjr Oi vey, he’s a millionaire, superstar, in the NBA and he’s afraid (cause that’s what it is) of the fans that tried to support him for as long as he’s been here? I didn’t miss a bunch of FTs in the playoffs? He should take a hard look at himself sack up and honor his contract.
@ethono_ @jumpjordan33 @__RichForever__ @CsportsK @knicks_tape99 When does Ben Simmons take some accountability? The guy played as bad as possible and wants to play victim. Being a nba superstar isn’t easy. Then don’t take the money.
@CJTheAnalyst @HoopsReference Simmons seems like a rich man’s Ricky Rubio, the teenager sold as Luka before Luka. He’s had a perfectly fine career, is still a FIBA superstar, just never a top NBA scorer.

It’s Sixers misuse of all those extra assets (Tobias?!) that led Simmons to verge of nervous breakdown.

@iamkendyll @BiasedHouston If you make 2 first team All NBA you are definitely a superstar. Length of play doesn’t matter, he’s one of the ten best players in the NBA but not better than Harden.

@wonder1369 I just don't get it man. Because somebody doesn't play like a superstar they don't care? Not everybody can be Giannis or Lebron, it's not like 99.9% of NBA players who aren't on that level aren't trying.
@absolutefil @FMSammy @CandaceDBuckner @curlyzack Anthony Davis will probably go down as the most overrated “superstar” in NBA history-no lie.. guy is so soft against talented bigs, such as Embiid, where he disappears. And gets injured every 8 games. But atleast he has a bubble championship with Lebron so that makes up for it <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>
@CrabSmutPeddler @tropicalblanket @GregSylvander “So, where does an overrated, fragile “superstar” averse to shooting go when he’s disgruntled? Anywhere he pleases in the NBA.”

Like who wrote this: skip bayless?
@ajtorres1230 Ben Simmons is a top tier passer man yall are so obsessed with this shooting thing you haven't seen the progress he's actually made.

It's a bummer for yall he's not a superstar but Ben Simmons is clearly a high level nba player
“He lacks a jumper. And free throw shooting. And the desire to expand his game beyond the painted area. And thick enough skin to listen to the truth without dismissing it as hating. Other than that, sure, Simmons is an NBA superstar.” https://t.co/HCHbqI4I9y

Why are we constantly reporting on Ben Simmons as if he’s a superstar NBA player <U+0001F602> https://t.co/OCMS1oK2J8
@MiroslavCuk @MysteryNtheRaw No, I would agree he was essentially also a role player (though one who was able to stand out more since his team didn't have a Jordan-esque superstar). But I'd say he's an exception re purely NBA players. And again, not intending to disparage Kukoc's career. I just think...
@HKhan2K Never forget Lebron has a highlight on every superstar and all star in the nba
What about Kobe being out scored for 3 of his 5 championships? That's like 70%. Most carried superstar in Nba history https://t.co/kcyxiJAWSU
@ColeSmi87671355 @MarcelasHoward On a team that is as bad as the Warriors, Steph “had” to do all of that (Any superstar on a shitty team will look like Gold. So miss me with the stats)

NBA is a team sport. If you can’t get them there, then you can’t get them there.

But as a talent, Steph is top 3 I. The league

If kd was a size 15 instead of a size 17 bucks wouldve lost and giannis would be the most overrated superstar in NBA history after losing to a team with one player doing everything https://t.co/zfWM1SHqbw
@the_ason @SportsRadioWIP Yup…not saying he is not nba worthy but he ain’t a superstar or a franchise guy. At one point he was considered by many top 15..then 20…now 30. Potential was never realized. At best a piece on a real contender.
He lacks a jumper &amp; free throw shooting. And the desire to expand his game beyond the painted area. And thick enough skin to listen to the truth without dismissing it as hating. Other than that, sure, #BenSimmons is an #NBA superstar. <U+0001F3C0> #Philadelphia76ers

@nba_dogg @lmaoolarry @KlayDaBest @coacheubankss33 Look at the date. 1968. He was playing against of much smaller, unathletic white dudes. Of course he put up crazy numbers. Im not saying he wasn’t great or wouldn’t be considered a superstar and regular all-pro today but there’s no way he averages anything close to those numbers.
@joelanthonystan @nick_stidham @jjjjay30 @jackfrank_jjf He’s an all nba player. That makes him one of the 3 best players at his position any given year. Whether you want to say star or superstar doesn’t change that he’d proven he has elite impact by making all nba at age 23-24
@ktnbotp888 Kpj was 20 years old the youngest player to score 50 ... his 2nd year in nba he scored 50 on the best 2way guard in league 9 3s 11 assist also . I expect giannis to score 50 he’s a superstar that’s what they do .

@DevaronPerry Really? Most have won titles. Today's NBA is the first to 120! 
I like scores. If you can't get me 25, you are not a superstar. 
Why would the worst offensive team trade a scorer for a player who can't shoot? He can't make free throws. Two missed free throw is a turnover.

Funny I’m told on the radio and on Twitter that Zach LaVine is an elite player in the NBA. A superstar. 

SI ranked him 29th and ESPN ranked him 33rd…

I like him but he definitely needs to take another step (and win some games) to be considered a superstar in the league.
I can't make this up y'all. Got contacted by a "influencer management site" thinking that our email address was somehow connected to NBA Superstar Larry Bird. Absolutely wild.
@Free_Haiti6 @seanjlongley @Khizwu @darwinchvz320 But I do think that that’s within the range of outcomes! 

The NBA has proven that continuity is super duper important. Unless you’re adding a superstar, and I do think KAT fits that billing.

Pair Bradley Beal with any Superstar in the nba , do they win a title with no other all stars on the team ? No.
@mrobthegoat @SBondyNYDN Simply put.. dudes (especially superstars) don’t want to play every single regular season game like it’s game seven of the finals. Is that kinda beat and slightly uncompetitive.. yes. But that’s the reality of the nba and it’s superstar treatment.. that’s why I like nash..
@Kmalikmusic @J135750 @sezarplayer @MOConnor_NBA I wouldn’t trade him…let his ass sit until another superstar is pissed and wants out. Not gonna win it all with or without him cuz the roster is flawed &amp; Glenn is the coach <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>

2. It’s Not LJ job or any other superstar to make any NBA PLAYER better. Since, you see, it’s THEIR job to improve throughout the years; since that’s what most  job requires of its employees
In another NBA Trade Prediction, I have the Timberwolves Superstar Karl Anthony Towns finally demanding a trade. He will end up on the Atlanta Hawks with Trae Young and John Collins

@PranavSriraman @realdealsniper @LottaHubris @Wadesburner And yes now I am glad I'm a Cavs fan but I hate when player get underrated just because their team is shit, this shouldn't be a thing in the NBA, every team has a good potential star and end up playing like an superstar or all star (Sexton) but become underrated cuz of their team

If Des has offensive superstar potential then Ford has defensive superstar potential. Ford played for a powerhouse HS program, @NorthMeckBall, and played a lot of big time programs. In fact, he even guarded Patrick Williams in HS, the 4th pick in the 2020 NBA Draft.
Imma just say this… Patrick Mahomes is not even more recognizable than some other players in the league and he’s the best player at the most high profile position. He’s not more popular than Luka Doncic, who is a global superstar but not the best at his spot. NBA &gt; NFL globally. https://t.co/KmZkFeSU7b
@mbamjv @Farbod_E So because he’s shown flashes of being a solid nba player, that makes him a potential superstar? Stay off the weed.

If an NBA promo didn't have "Superstar" by Lupe Fiasco back when that record was big, did it truly exist? 

The answer is no.
@blkmaniam63 @LakersNation The NBA says thanks for funding the luxury tax. This incentivizes the small market teams to tank until they land a superstar.
@avi_sankar @The_6ix_man Kawhi was/is better than KAT, who has accomplished exactly nothing in his NBA career. And look at the pu pu platter that went out for Harden. 

Assuming KAT (who has a slightly higher PER than Chris Boucher) is a superstar, it's only worth acquiring a superstar if they're cheap.
So true NBA superstar Kevin Durant https://t.co/h3H5HfCySr
@TheHoopCentral He's the best player in the nba it's just he doesn't have another superstar playing with him.

@IanKenyonNFL sorry I can't hear you my superstar just did a 50-piece to close out an NBA Finals
First the plan: In the NBA, you can not win without a superstar. It’s a superstar driven league even more so than the NHL. The best way to ensure a top pick that can become that is to lose. A lot.
However the Sixers desperate desire for a second superstar to pair with Embiid May have caused them to downplay the red flags with Simmons. The other problem is, the NBA is such a superstar driven league, that teams are far more easily held hostage when a big star wants out
@cclark3000 Poor guy. When he was leaking to NBA writers and badmouthing @KingJames he was all the rage. @wojespn couldn't hurl enough superlatives his way. Now...You never "win" a trade for an NBA superstar unless you received that star. The talking heads and writers, and there were many,

@Sixers_Matt Ppl are too quick these days to elevate flawed players into the superstar stratosphere that it's hard to convince them that a guy is fundamentally trash. Ben is G league material but folks will call me a hater for saying this. U can't be in the NBA and refuse to shoot or can't.
Twitter has really come full circle with JR Smith live tweeting college. Back in the day it was just random people posting the most mundane stuff, and now we’ve returned to the same thing except it’s a former NBA superstar and he’s getting millions of likes.

@MaffieuMufasa For a 3 time Allstar, 2 time NBA first team all defense, 24 year old emerging superstar that can guard 1 through 4. Still hasn’t reached his peak. Let’s be honest you can win a ship with Harden and KD why not add defensive and playmaking
I am not overstating this when I say over his 13 seasons in the NBA, Russell Westbrook has proven to be the worst superstar jump shooter in the history of pro basketball. @undisputed. 9:30 AM-Noon ET. FS1. https://t.co/0c9qyNDIfv
@AnthonyLGargano @BenSimmons25 @sixers This is in no way the @sixers fault @BenSimmons25 average NBA player at his best was treated like a superstar as an average player. Even the Australian people were happy he didn't play this summer. LeBron don't want him in LA. Soft Soft Soft
@StoolGreenie Do they not realize that legit 3/4 of NBA players could make this same reel with open knockdown shots? Also he’s good but superstar is insane. Lakers are the worst.
@BigJones5577 @mommas_baby123 @ZachLowe_NBA Keep telling yourself KAT is a superstar, lmk how that works out. Jokic went to the playoffs prior to Jamal Murray being a star. James harden did it for years in Houston before getting a second star. Kawhi in San Antonio. Superstars make the playoffs regardless
@ZachLowe_NBA In what world is KAT a superstar?
@mommas_baby123 @ZachLowe_NBA Empty stats mean nothing and even the empty stats you provided don’t back up a superstar. A superstar is an all star starter almost every year, not getting into the game sometimes and making 3rd team all nba. He needed jimmy butler and thibs the only time he made the playoffs.
@BobbyColemanCSG @WestSS_101 @terron_francis @CenturyOG @overtime @CursolaCursed @Thortontucker @Lakers Average nba player nah superstar I don’t think so but he can definitely be an all star player. Lakers FO believe in him and he’s only 20 he’s shown some great glimpses of what he can do and he’s learning from a bunch of HOF players he been grinding every off season
@FirstTake Ben Simmons can't shoot.  He's a career 15.9 ppg player.  In today's NBA, if you can't score, you are a role player.  If you can't get buckets, you're supporting cast.  He's being paid superstar type money.  If he would just work on his shot, he'd be damned near unstoppable.
@joestev80183791 @mommas_baby123 @ZachLowe_NBA Did you just compare being an all star starter to being a superstar? <U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923> you mean the game where the fans vote in the starters?

Jalen Green should have went number 1 overall, Cade doesn't deserve the slack and hate he'll recieve from NBA fans/Pistons fans when he doesn't live up to the hype of being a superstar <U+0001F62C><U+0001F614>
Still laughing at that account claiming THT is going to be a SUPERSTAR one day <U+0001F62D>

The chances he’s ever a Top 50 player is slim, but there’s like 5-8 legit SUPERSTARS in the entire NBA <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>
No he won’t and that’s perfectly okay. It’s not a failure to be a high level role player/starter which I think he probably can be instead of a bonafide superstar which there is only about 10-12 of in the NBA. Just setting him up for slander lol https://t.co/KrAlznEKqe
@Og_Django @BenDove007 @JacksonStrayerr @wojespn If he's afraid to get fouled by Trae Young or Danilo Gallinari he's not mentally tough enough to be an NBA superstar, he's overpaid, and he deserves to be criticized.
#NBA why does Ben Simmons act like hes a superstar<U+2620><U+FE0F> who tf wants that bum
At the heart of the Ben Simmons problem is that he's always just wanted the image of being an NBA superstar without actually doing the work of being an NBA superstar.
NBA fans are legit gay and attracted to certain players cuz what on this green earth makes you think tyrone horton tucker will be a superstar???
@chaboieastwood Nice win against Sam Dekker, the NBA superstar<U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602> what year was this??
@JordanWise1 @Will_Rucker3_AD The sixers only got a meeting with LeBron because they had 3 potential superstars(Embiid, Ben, fultz), a max slot, the most draft assets in the NBA, and 3 and D guys. Philly won’t ever sign a superstar in free agency
Today we have a few of cards to highlight, a HALL OF FAMER, a current superstar &amp; an up &amp; coming rookie. First up from our "CHASE THE TUA" multi-sport edition is a Pro Set Magic Johnson autographed card released by @Leaf_Cards.

I feel like JJ Redick was the last Great American Whiteboy in the NBA. 
A Superstar.
He's a couple levels above Hayward and Allen.
@jtylerconway That’s because he wasn’t a nba superstar as well once he became a role player the hate went with it people hate anybody that is great in anything they do don’t know why <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>

This Ben Simmons trade speculation is just so unrealistic and a never ending thing. The sixers want a superstar + 3 players + 18234959 draft picks + rights to the stadium (probably) but he isn't good enough to play for them? @WorldWideWob

Wilt Chamberlain, an NBA superstar and lifelong bachelor, claimed to have had sex with 20,000 women. No wonder your dad wesn't getting any.
Dead end bench NBA player can be a superstar in Euro
love the wording that “Paul George ran into Donovan Mitchell” as if your entire profile isn’t dedicated to a man who ended a 30/7/4, All NBA, All-Defensive superstar’s post season with a dirty hip check in the closing minutes of a game they were going to lose anyway. https://t.co/Lp5Lo98SVp
@imoMitchCards @soft_toss_lefty Team championships shouldn't be looked at in baseball (unlike a NBA superstar).  AL v NL career should warrant a look when considering ERA as well.
@QCSportsPod @NBAMemes First of all I really don’t care how much money he made <U+0001F602> Being the 400th best player has its perks I guess lol &amp; well Patrick McCaw won three in a row if we doing the ring argument &amp; I’m not saying every player should be a superstar but I don’t like “nba meme” players
@bigmoneysantos @NBAMemes The man is a millionaire, was one of the best 400 players on the planet for over a decade, nba champion. I mean damn, what more do you want. Every player in the league can’t be a superstar.
@JusticeFor_Nash Yeah his defense is the biggest aspect of his game but in todays nba landscape idk if defense is good enough to be the main thing about a superstar with how spaced out and limited defenders are. He can do a lot with a team but idk about consistent contention
They need to shorten the NBA season if they want a better product in the regular season. 82 games is too long. 40 game range would be better and you’d get better play from superstar cause games would matter more.
@NBAMemes he isn’t wrong... people underestimate how good at basketball a benchwarmer in the NBA is. Sure they may not be an NBA Superstar, but if some random high schooler challenges them... well, the high schooler’s getting destroyed

@TheHoopCentral @ESPNPR So Racial Nichols was relieved from her show, and they're giving Malika "Pretty Thang" Andrews the show with a different name? I'm all for it! Hopefully Malika Andrews covers the the whole NBA, and not just one spoiled, aging superstar who made Mrs. Nichols wet between her legs.

Panther/Texans on Thursday night this week - I'm a Panthers fan but I mean who tf else cares other than the small Panthers fan base.

NFL needs to focus more on highlighting the big rivalries.

Also the lack of a superstar like the NBA has with Lebron.
@Michelobius it's extremely bizarre to me. nothing about his performance last year suggests, like, superstar to me. and i certainly would not expect him to be one of the best defenders in the NBA next year like a lot of people are suggesting.
Sean Marks is moving and grooving.

Marks was leading a super kiwi type of Brooklyn Nets team - low key, development, punching up.

Marks now leads a superstar Brooklyn Nets team.

@LeQuan_God @SonOfSamHinkie @NBAKrell Ben Simmons is not a bad contract, all 29 teams would take him in if he wasn't priced as a superstar as the 76ers have him in trades. Wall is the worse contract in the NBA and in the traditional open market wouldn't get half of his amount

@MicahAdams13 An old adage in the nba is, “anytime you can as a superstar in exchange for role players you do it”. Haters want to add the following caveat to that saying: “unless it’s Westbrook”. Seems like people are reaching.
One superstar that was left off the NBA’s all-time Top 50 was Dominique Wilkins. Hopefully he’ll make the Top 75 since he easily has the career resume to back it up. But there will no doubt be other NBA stars who don’t make the final Top 75 list. Can hardly wait for its release.

@Phllee8194Lee Disagree respectfully. He lost that opportunity in 2011 when he had the biggest meltdown in nba finals history for a superstar player ever. Only shot from my perspective he may have is probably at 4 maybe and or top 5 but that's just my perspective.
