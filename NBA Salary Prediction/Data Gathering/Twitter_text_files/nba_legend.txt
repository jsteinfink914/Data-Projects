@BangoBurner Different philosophies i guess. Thinking they’re the best worked out for almost every nba legend.
Larry Legend's getting his own museum! Do you think he'd be a top 10 player in today's NBA?

@nydc02 @POTUS1012 @harris_stavrou Nobody is saying Luka wont pass him, im sure he will. But im speaking right now. Right now Luka is not top 100. Some years from now he might be top 50 for all I know, but that's still to be decided. To me a true NBA legend is not that many players.
person I 
aspire to be, he's my light of day. The way his music 
flows and sounds is extravagant and pleasant. 
Youngboy is an icon, a legend, my idol, a King, an

understand this. I Love NBA Youngboy. Youngboy,

This whole Nikki Minaj controversy made me think of this video. Charles Barkley is right.

@HonestLarry1 Russell Westbrook is in many ways Fat Lever 2.0.

From 1986-87 to 1989-90, Lever's 4-year statistical peak: 

19.0 PPG 
8.9 RPG 
7.6 APG 
2.5 SPG 

For a 6'3 combo guard.

He's still 10th all-time in career triple doubles.

Forgotten completely by younger NBA fans.

Legend.

The best thing about getting to see Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys tonight was drinking, dancing and watching NBA legend Bill Walton at the next table thoroughly having a blast.  He’s so TALL! He has a lot of back problems but he danced to every song.  Super sweet guy <U+2665><U+FE0F> https://t.co/oLvB9UXjYR

@WalshFreedom The NBA should poll HOF players on who they would want as their 4 starting teammates, I expect Larry Legend would be on a lot of their lists. He could put up 50 or 0 &amp; dominate the game.

@ninerempiregsw @urkle9 Any team that had Lebron James after 09' has been trying to be as excellent and ready as possible for them to contend with an NBA legend (Steph Curry) in our case, no reason to have half roster of guys who are just now learning to play.
