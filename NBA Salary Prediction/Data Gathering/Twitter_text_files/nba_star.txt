After requesting offseason trade, Philadelphia 76ers All-Star Ben Simmons won't be at training camp https://t.co/lcCh29Q3cZ https://t.co/xDog0EL5xP
@SportsCenter Now he don't want to be famous. Being interviewed and an NBA star that comes with a territory. It's like him coming to my job telling me don't be doing my job.
@mjhprep @JeriTsaiNets @WorldWideWob makes sense, he was a former player after all. but just getting along with star players is far from the only responsibility. most nba coaches can do that, it's the Xs and Os, maximizing efficiency with rotations, ect that are what defines them.
Aren't Bradley Beal and Jayson Tatum literally from the same area? do these guys not talk to each other at all or just read IG stories and not listen to what fellow NBA players have experienced

@lyssah_a Yep 100% think it will impact player’s ability to find new roster spots unless they are a super star. It’s embarrassing what’s going on right now with the NBA.

@JClarkNBCS @NBCPhiladelphia @BR_NBA @ZachLowe_NBA @TyJohnsonNews @NBCSPhilly @Ike58Reese @NoahLevick @Jacko2544 Im out on sixers  until doc is gone. I’m tired of them telling us it’s our fault. Ben got more slack then any star player ever. Ppl were out  on Harper before this ridiculous run he’s on and he didn’t play that bad last year.

@NitiApplebum I do believe it’s more difficult for silver because the nba is a star driven league but you stilt gotta put ya foot down
My question is Adam Silver strong enough to say these players, star players in the NBA that aren’t vaccinated can’t play until they are?
@ekoreen The thing about the NBA is as s star-driven league there's greater individual power on all matters. In most cases that's great, but it also means the individual's opportunity for self-determination is put ahead of the desires of the larger group.
We in the press should stop accepting these “requests for privacy” as a valid response. Being willfully unvaccinated recklessly endangers others. That’s inarguable. Letting folks like @KyrieIrving off with that answer helps them escape any accountability. https://t.co/MKhz0UZGnR
@YouKnowMyVibes @GuruLakers Star in your role.<U+0001F604><U+0001F604><U+0001F604> These Youngbloods can’t be trusted under NBA Playoff pressure. Carmelo is battle tested over many years. a 6’9 Power Forward that provides Floor Spacing at 40% for 3-pointers.
@BrususLaLegend7 @BleacherReport @billoram @ShamsCharania @sam_amick It’s the trend with majority of star players.
How else are you going to beat the defending NBA Champion Milwaukee Bucks ? Landing Jrue Holiday as a 2-Way Player was the missing link. Star players joining forces.
Chauncey Billups put it simply when asked about keeping Damian happy. Said there's 2 typed of teams in the NBA: Teams that have a super star and teams that are looking for one

@StoryOfToxic @BADGEPLUG The builds in current gen are far from reveal nba players. There are builds that exceed in one thing and can do another pretty good but not great. Next Gen you can have 2 things you exceed at and one that you are pretty good at like most all star players.

So who, based on their remarks, is suspected of being an unvaccinated NBA star?

<U+25CF> Kyrie?
<U+25CF> Beal?
<U+25CF> Isaac?
<U+25CF> Lebron?

I guess Lebron is based on silence or because he demurred when asked about it? https://t.co/7HTcf05YJ6
@BryanIsTheKing Put differently, I think you're thinking about it the wrong way. Lowry was already a world-class athlete, as a star NBA player, and yet the Heat's program got him into *noticeably* better shape. That's an amazing credit to Lowry's determination *and* the Heat's rigorous program.
What the roster lacks in star power, it makes up in players who are young, hungry and ready to put their stamp on the NBA. https://t.co/R08Ok6bYed

@BrandonWint_ Lol first team all defense and all nba second team and an all star, it’s Ben’s fault for not getting better than the max contract he earned. Lol your fandom is tinting your perception.
@ojkobs Maybe he could have improved. He went from rookie of the year to all star to all nba and first all defense and runner up in dpoy. Sure he could shoot some jumpers but to say he didn’t improve is dishonest in my opinion.
@HLoc_Da_Gawd No he hasn’t CJ is not good enough. How many all star games CJ made? What’s his career assist to turnover ratio? How many all nba teams he made? He not good enough dame wouldn’t play off ball to someone not good enough Ben Simmons is clearly better than CJ at pg duties.
@FCKNJORDAN lol all nba second team. First team all defense. All star. He don’t shoot you right he is not unprofessional nothing he has done would indicate that. He didn’t bad mouth them, even they did bad mouth him he is within the rules of his contract. He asked for a trade. Gotta move on.

@Oscar__NBA Jaylen averaged 25 ppg on 48/40 and is an all star. If he’s on the floor with like Dennis, PP, Al/Rob, and then either Romeo/Aaron theyre gonna be fine

They’ll obviously be staggering the Jays
@Oscar__NBA Paying Kemba $40M was hell. Forced the team to play him 30+ MPG and crunch time. Dennis for what we pay him and will play him is a *huge* upgrade over having to play Kemba in a star role.

And you can’t say we lost Fournier when we really never had him. He’s really good though

Is @sixers star @BenSimmons25 the CRYBABY of the @NBA???

#NBA #HereTheyCome #NBATwitter #BenSimmons
Can we admit that @sixers star @BenSimmons25 is the biggest crybaby in the @NBA??? Ben Simmons has no talent and the #Sixers should not trade him and call his bluff to sit out the season.

@itsjwills Ok, so age 27 Giannis &gt; age 27 Hakeem.  But Hakeem ended his career with an MVP, 2 titles, 2 Finals MVPs, and 2 DPOYs, plus was a 12 time All Star and 6x NBA 1st team.  Giannis has not matched Hakeem's career yet.
@mikegrib8 Been watching Lopez for a while now. As a high school prospect, I think the best case scenario (before the OTE) was being a contributor on a high major, but not a star nor an NBA prospect (unless dramatic growth occurs).
@LPizzle every other day I was someone else. NBA star, Pro BMX rider, pimp, comedian, superheroe, kung fu master, video game champion  - the shit never ended. These kids just stare into their phones these days. And these new cartoons are partly to blame as well. Dumbed down and corny af.

@ChxseShe @KyrieUnderrated @untuckedkai @BillyReinhardt Look I think Kyrie is a good player but Dame is better. Dame has been All NBA 6x double the number of times Kyrie has been selected. Dame has been 1st team something Kyrie has never achieved. Dame never the last 4 seasons are superior. He led his team to WCF as the lone All Star.
@SaquonMVP @untuckedkai @BillyReinhardt Dame is the better player and the stats and success he has had as the lone star on his team backs that up. Dame took his team to the WCF, has 6 All NBA selections to 3 for Kyrie. He made All NBA 1st team something Ky has never achieved. Two walk off buzzer beaters in the playoffs
@MikeTheHump_ @untuckedkai @BillyReinhardt Lillard has been All NBA 6x and made 1st team.. Dame as the lone All Star on his team took Portland to the WCF. Kyrie never made the playoffs without another All Star. Kyrie never been 1st team All NBA, and has only 3 All NBA selections. All the data points to Dame being better.

@mitchmeezy1 @_itsmarkymark Why was MJ an all star in his 2nd year in the NBA?
@FanMahome Harden in 2017 had one of the biggest Star collapse in nba history. After underperforming every playoffs, In do or die game 6 of 2017 WC semifinals, he took 11 shots total(2 inside 3 pt) for 10 points &amp; 6 TOs. That year he was 2nd in mvp vote. Did Rockets toss him under the bus?
Bron had Wiggins traded when the whole world thought he will be a future star. 

Imagine the jokes Lebron would be hearing now if Wiggins turned out to be great. 

LeGM ended up being a better talent evaluator than 3/4 of the NBA GMs.
The bar we have set for this man to clear is the lowest out of any Star in the NBA. I don’t get it. https://t.co/Z6y4iwF8oI

@HerroSexuals @AdebayoPlsWin Not really. Both had a solid second season and Herro can make the leap. Nothing wild about a 20 year old lottery pick having star potential.

@KOT4Q Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum become a Top 7 Duo in the NBA and make the All Star game again
Also more than 20 women came out saying he cheated on him with them like lmao. Lets not pretend if an NBA all star cheated on there wife it wouldnt be two media cycles or so. Infidelity isnt cool.

@douglaslwhite @gifdsports Simmons refuses to shoot. And in the playoffs, he won't even drive to the basket, because he's afraid to be fouled. 

It's not like I wanted or expected him to shoot 3s. A star PG should take 10-15 shots a game and hit even half his FT. That's not a big ask of any NBA player.

@imdjluis @StephanieHypez To be an NBA/NFL star, you would have excelled in the sport prior to signing. That’s not necessarily the case with WWE. Especially since now they won’t even be pulling from indies. 

I understand branding but that comparison is bs
@Comedian_NickM @StephanieHypez First, it’s WWE’s way of branding their talents unique to their company. But also, Triple H’s explanation makes perfect sense. Anyone can become a wrestler. Not everyone can become a WWE Superstar. Anyone can play basketball or football. Not everyone can become an NBA/NFL star.
@FreeBirdJen You really are brainwashed lol keep watching! Nothing will change this nba season. Nobody cares if a bench player sits out! No star player will put up his $10 million! 99.9% of the players will go what they need to, to play!

@freedarko Of course it doesn’t mean that, but it also means he chose to be in a position that gives him greater influence and structural power than the average nba player (and that’s separate from being a star, which also does). So his actions are just genuinely more important.
At the annual summer meeting of the NBA player’s union, star players made clear that a vaccine requirement mandated by the league would be a “non-starter.” https://t.co/bcvr7Acxk8 via @RollingStone
@Patrick_Fenelon he’s a star
acting like stringing together a decade of 16/8/7 with first team all D and perennial all star placements wouldn’t be HoF https://t.co/FIP66CAwyy

@clarencecooper4 @LuckyL99897031 @JoeTordy One more time, the point is they're players that didn't make it that are better than him. Do you disagree? Do you think GMs sign players based on they're all star appearances or if they made an all nba 3rd team?

@LAker_weez @D4DcRIES @LifeLongSunsFan @StevenKelsey13 You mean a 2 time all star in Ilguaskas, and guys that had very respectable nba careers like Varejao, Snow, Marshall, Hughes, and Henderson. 

Side note he was 21 y/o.
@HPbasketball @Kungu_NBA As an outisder, I just don’t see how anyone could make the case that the star driven leadership of the last decade has been good for the NBA union as a whole.  Maybe I’m wrong, but see also the over 36 rule change being a priority and the cap spike
@wytmerj @LordMcKeown @JayNeon8 @LakerCentral365 Lol you didn’t answer the question you went around by bringing up kyrie first three years like he wasn’t the rookie of the year and all star year 2 while playing with the sorriest team in nba history… hell when have steph did anything without a true superstar
@D_Portillo_0 I Laker ring would mean absolutely nothing since these bitches don't like competition &amp; join/recruit the top talent. Same with the Nets. Bunch of star/superstars acting like divas, signing large contracts, failing &amp; demanding trades to preferred destinations. NBA is a joke

@WajahatAli The @NBA should MANDATE vaccines for all staff, coaches, fans &amp; players.

Every level should have vaccine mandates.

It's insane that a star player like Karl Anthony Towns lost 7 family members to Covid &amp; his peers are still anti-vaxxers.
@mnsports3 @NBAKrell You are projecting Edwards to be an first team nba defensive player and multiple time All Star. Ben is already one. I wouldn’t do it if I was Minnesota bc they are still young. But Philly shouldn’t without him bc Joel getting Older.
@yuhhmelo he was NOLA’s only marketable star and the NBA knew that letting him leave while they were in the process of finding someone to buy the team would be dumb he was the main attraction at the time. NOLA had been bought by the time he went to the clippers, so it wasn’t an issue then
@ClutchCity20__ @Hfromtx @BiasedHouston Luka also been in the league 3 years and  harden for over 10 at this point in harden career he definitely didn’t have 2 back to back all star selections let alone 2 b2b all nba first teams it’s makes no sense to compare playoff success when years played are far apart
@UtdTorkel It really isn’t lol, a few bad games and people really forget everything huh? ROTY, 4x all star, 1x all NBA, multiple time DPOY candidate (could easily have been DPOY but big’s always get the votes).. all in 4 years
@justin_02__ @TheRocketsStan @maxistweetin @LegendOfWinning he would find success but he wouldn’t be 5 MVP 11 rings bill russell. most i could see bill being is a perennial all star and all nba player, but his lack of outside shot would hinder him
@SamuraiFoochs @eLRoMo777 @RuFan130 first stop the aunt shit, that dont mean him, he aint sub tweet nothing about covid, and the social media likes is a problem. like i said either there are a bunch of weird nba players, like nicki in the league, or yall buying a painted narrative. but the idea that a star stop u

What a way to start! https://t.co/trX39GeC8k
@5StraightFinaIs @jmoney_hoops @LakerCentral365 I don’t think he’s being forced cause the NBA is not implementing a vaccine mandate. It’s on Kyrie to decide whether he wants to play or not. Knowing Kyrie and his relationship with science, the Nets are going to miss an All Star for at least 41 games this season

Imagine the  star players forming their own league,it's possible,they've got enough money to do it .
If you can’t make the NBA just change you gender you’ll be a star in the WNBA just like Juwanna Mann
@lewoysmithjr @BronZionx @RianJoh07273170 @haiti4eva @aRoseCLE216 @mjs23goat Correct. Kyrie is not only all nba, but easily makes the all star team if he doesn’t miss games.
@iamkendyll @HooperDrakexX @BiasedHouston It’s high key disrespectful. Kukoc was a fantastic role player who did his job extremely well but he wasn’t an all star talent or anything. 

Luka is coming off back to back 1st team all NBA selections. He’s the best player under 25 by a fist margin rn

@AshNicoleMoss I have a feeling he will be exempt somehow. No way the NBA allows one of it's star players on a super team miss so many games. Especially when the preferred Finals matchup is Lakers vs Nets.
@Notdeadzhot He won’t be all star but he gone be like 20 PPG with all nba defence
@SInow Kareem is entitled to his opinion. The NBA hasn't mandated the vaccine, different cities like SF,NYC has its own policies. Nobody knows if the league number one box office star Lebron is vaxxed. Everything is all over the place right now.

@MNIN__ Right, silly of me to assume that Irving and NBA appearing in the same article couldn't have possibly indicated that it's NBA star Kyrie Irving who feels this way.
@TheNBACentral Anthony Edwards is good but is the prediction for him to be an all star ever year, all nba defensive team, all nba team, and potentially a runner up for dpoy? I get he scores more but is that everyone is comparing?

@rasika79 NBA has the East vs West all star game, which for a while the West ran away with because of all the talent on those teams. They moved to a draft model, and has been pretty good since.
@sullduggery "The NBA claims that 90 percent of its more than 450 players — star veterans and players trying to make rosters alike — have received at least one shot, a rate lower than the conservative NFL"

Menos que la NFL. 
MENOS.
@brooknetsboy8 @NoahShachtman @soshnick @RollingStone “The NBA claims that 90 percent of its more than 450 players — star veterans and players trying to make rosters alike — have received at least one shot.”
The league is 74.2% black.
Wait, so the “Earth is flat” NBA star is a vaccine conspiracy theorist too?
@DjDaDawn You must have forgot how good Cousins was before he got hurt. He did all of that you're giving Jokic credit for, minus the mvp jokic won in a season every star was hurt. Cousins also was stuck on one of the most horrible run franchises in the NBA.
@cyntiadkins @NoahShachtman @brianstelter @RollingStone That's right Cindy. Replacing a seven time NBA All Star is easy.

@ShaunStevensYea I am pretty sure she was saying the same thing. He is acting like an entitled superstar but he isn’t. This is the future of the NBA and we are at a cross roads, if the Sixers give in too easily, could give the All Star level players even more leeway to do it in the future

@AWIII75 @J135750 @sezarplayer @MOConnor_NBA Brogdon is the wildcard because he’s a better fit with Joel and a borderline all star(In the East) when healthy. Maxey would serve as insurance if/when he misses time. The picks are valuable in a potential Dame/Beal package
@philfanacc Reminder that the best post player in the NBA is often forced to play on the perimeter way more than he should because his all star “PG” doesn’t have the skill or desire to do so<U+0001F602><U+0001F937><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>
@2dah2 @HadFame_ @TheHoopCentral And I’m simply asking which of the guys I put ahead of him is he more vital to BK than they are to their teams? It’s not like I’m putting scrubs ahead of him these are All Star/All NBA players too. The level in talent is close enough to where that’s the difference for me.
@SpikeEskin I’m pretty sure everything he’s gotten the last 4 years (All Star, All NBA, All Defensive, Max contract) was because of what he does well so in what way is he not being respected?<U+0001F602><U+0001F926><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>.

@JoeMullinax I would pack Bane or Brooks up myself. Why do people think they are getting a 3 time All Star for backups?  It is the silliest thing on NBA twitter right now.
@atptour @LaverCup @rogerfederer Laver Cup must change its format if it wants to have longeviity. It should follow the @NBA’s all star game format where the 2 top players will be on the opposing sides and have there draft picks so matcges would be more intriguiging and competitive.
@DerekBodnerNBA What a joke of a take. This is terrible for the nba, a max player (who isn’t a star) demanding out with 4 years left on his contract. Bad precedent to set.
@swishcultures_ @Ballislife @BenSimmons25 @ChrisJHoops He can do this all he wants in the summer, we ain’t falling for it again <U+0001F602> until he consistently does these things in an nba game he will never be a star just like @shaq said

@FcMilera @VardyMagic @PeakeTony @Adelaide_FC What does Ben Simmons have to do with this? 

He’s a 3 time NBA All Star. He isn’t the issue, philly not have the depth to complete for an NBA title is. 

Don’t rewrite the narrative to suit your agenda.
@HoodieBronn okay what nba star doesn’t get criticized when they play poorly in the playoffs? he’s very good but his aggressiveness and passion doesn’t show on court at times. he can’t be mad when embiid is carrying while being unhealthy, with that contract he has to own up to it and change
@RhysJinWoo @HanaHoops They go over this every time, the nba owned the team and wanted it to have value so they could sell the franchise. They didnt wanna send off the star player in that situation. The NBA doesn't own the Nets or any other team for that matter so its irrelevant.

Tony Allen was never elite. Neither was Iggy. Both of them were all nba second team with Noah 2010-2011.

In general I'm not really seeing what other people see with Boston.

Ofcourse they have a all nba guy and an all star both very young and good on both sides of the court but this team is just lacks so much shooting and playmaking from the back court.
Idk guys John Wall is a multiple time All Star 

One time all nba 3rd team and 1 time defensive team.

We should trade him for that bum Ben Simmons

@HVDCastro The people comparing him to kobe (Stephen A) are in the vast minority looking for clicks. Dude has literally never been voted into an all star game for goodness sake. 10-15 in the NBA is about on-par for him at this stage. He's overdue for some respect - from a huge booker fan.

@DavidBr37616769 @BynumInDaPost @sixers @NBA @BenSimmons25 @dmorey This is dumb.

He is not hoping for an injury. What he's saying is that if Embiid is injured, there is no other star to carry the load.

The team quit on Ben last yr when they tried to send him to Houston until he is 30, after he signed his rookie max &amp; said he loved Philly.
@IAmEGoody @TotenhamS @ICYBOLSZN Son, you called him lazy.

By the age of 24, he's already begun his HoF career.

ROTY (21)
3x All Star (22, 23 &amp; 24)
2x All NBA D (23, 24)

3x 2nd rd playoffs (21, 22, 24)
(Team swept w/o him 23)

You don't do all that being lazy.
@__RichForever__ @knicks_tape99 Believe me the NBA doesn’t want a 25 year old all star to not play on year 2 of a deal he just signed - it sets a horrible precedent
Which NBA star has the toughest career to associate with one team? (You think of them almost equally as a member of two different teams.)
@gxg_05 @JoshEberley Lol he was a franchise player for the Magic eastern conference champion, and 3 straight DPOTY, 6x all star, 5x all nba first team, 4x all defensive first team. He’s been a role player on one championship with the Lakers at the tail end of his career.
I mean, he gets paid to bring views to his channel. Why wouldn’t he post about the biggest star in the nba? https://t.co/zL63D89sIK
@LancexDeebo @SadKumingaFan_ I don’t see any star potential in Moody. He likely ends up being a solid NBA player and contributor (good value for the 14th pick).

@gmastrangelo18 @SixersNationCP Yet, his accolades speak for themselves. Spoken like someone putting unrealistic expectations on a player who’s only 25. Imagine having a talent that makes all nba, all defensive always in the running for DPOY every year is an all star and crying about what he cannot do. Stupid
@joewesling @barstoolsports If an NBA player shoots 30% he's a scrub. If an MLB player hits 30% he's an all star. Regardless of talent hitting aany pitch, let alone a HR, is the harder thing to do
@ThankYouTaceGod @DanielOgle13 @SteelKanuck @2EZ4LAKERSTZY @The_Barftender The warriors never signed him to tat contract. Minnesota did early in his career when he was still touted to be a premier all star. Which clearly isn’t the case now. 

Hence why any knowledgable basketball fan acknowledges his contract as one of the worst in the NBA.
@AndrewMG77 @PatrickRuffini I can’t watch NFL anymore since I got into college football. Weird thing is I’m basketball it’s opposite. I find college basketball bad, and NBA (from the all -star game when things pick up) a much better experience.
The disrespect on Derrick Rose’s MVP is wild. He won 62 games without an all star or all nba teammate that year.
@MaxJullian_ But that’s the truth lol none of them made all star or all nba team. Might be the only time a 60 win team had just one guy make all star team. Noah and Boozer missed a lot of games that year. Incredible season from Rose

@Hoops_NBA_ Is Simmons still a perennial all star? I'm not sure his reputation is that great anymore to keep getting those nods. Especially if the FT shooting bogeyman rears its ugly head again.
Simmons development is pretty disappointing even compared to a more normal NBA star, who has youth success, NCAA success, and then NBA success. Lacking any progress as a result of shotmaking growth seems to hurt and probably has contributed to lack of on-ball development
@Hoops_NBA_ Like, last season Simmons beat out Trae Young for an all star spot? Do we think that happens again? I think to this point Simmons has had a pretty sterling reputation league wide that has helped his accolades be so much better than similar players, but that might change.

@SpartanBengal @CartierSellout @WNBxDeuce @zDGHOOPS That's not my point. You're comparing last year's Warriors to the 06 Lakers with a star dragging them to the playoffs (which Curry didn't) 

That year Kobe was considered the 4th best in the NBA because of his lack of team success, it shouldn't be that crazy if Curry's the same.

@pagelbagel92 @203GX @isiah_nba Ok. So, is Tatum Jordan? LeBron? Steph? Duncan? Shaq? Kobe? Even KG? They have no path to add a third star post extensions, and aren't legit contenders. They're trying to thread the Dirk Mavs 04 Pistons needle for a single championship. Why would Tatum stay in a cold weather high
@pagelbagel92 @203GX @isiah_nba I'm a Celtics fan
How has blocking any path to max space and paying market value to Smart and way over market value to a guy that has played over 28 minutes once in his career, with no draft picks, and older than Tatum Pritchard your best rookie deal, setting a path to a 3rd star
@BballCeltics33 @pagelbagel92 @203GX @isiah_nba I'm willing. But Richardson and Juancho are terrible. Schroder was fine. Just locking up Smart and especially Williams long term is super risky. Especially Williams. Now they need him not only healthy but to become that third all star. Or they need Beal to pull a Harden.
@203GX @isiah_nba I've been in this conversation before with Kyle Kuzma. When Tatum leaves for the Lakers maybe the slander will stop? Slander Jaylen, he's not a true star all nba guy. It's not Tatum's fault that the Celtics suck it's Danny's.

@thatdudejohn901 @doomsdavey @TheHoopCentral Remind you Luka damn near had a goal medal this year went crazy in the olympics without an NBA star <U+0001F602><U+0001F602> but I guess those players could do that too yall got it I rest my case
@Sean_Barnard1 That's the crazy thing about the NBA, you only have to be right once. They got it right, and are in the discussion for conference finals.   That's also what kind of sucks about the NBA, you can't build a team, it's all star hunting or tanking
@LocksScuzzy @jackfrank_jjf @JVSwaps Im a Ben hater as much as anyone.. but he easily has one of the most impressive resumes to start a career in nba history. 4 seasons, 3 all star games, 2 first team all defense

The eye test makes you laugh at the idea of him being a HOF'er, but resume wise he's had a great start
@TopTierCrown I’m just saying, 2 out of the past 3 years, he was the 2x MVP, the DPOY, the all star game mvp, first team all nba defense, multiple seasons, scores more than kd, more efficient  and the nba champion and a finals mvp- it’s time to give him his due.
@MichaelZherdev @Orange_and_Ploo @seanyebitch it’s correct. if you seriously believe rjs on tatums level the. he should average 23.7.4 on 58 TS%, an all star, all nba third team,close to all defense, average 25 in the playoffs leading his team to the conference finals
@legsanity @pepperedsalami Yea, no. Obviously you need a good return. Nobody cares about your opinion means nothing. They'll wait til another disgruntled star wants out also and swap or for Ben to finally suit up after missing the first 20 and not getting paid while being fined.

@J_Easyy @ChazC318 Lol nah I’m saying that contract shit don’t matter in the nba when a star wanna leave.
@phillystreetcat @jackfrank_jjf Basketball HOF is the easiest of the 4 to get in. Well idk about hockey tbh. But in 4 career playing years he has 3 all star appearances an all nba nod and an all defensive team award. If he continues that kind of trajectory he’ll make it.
Ben Simmons has played 4 NBA seasons. 

3x all star (voted by coaches) 
2x all defense 
All rookie 
Rookie of the year 
All NBA nod 

If you are a small market team and have a chance at Ben he is 100% worth trading for. And thats what Philly has in their favor.

How many players have that on their resume before turning 25? Are these not the things looked at when determining a HOF career? 

Seems like he is on a HOF trajectory <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>
@RickyCast10 @SimmonsPlease @ptknicksblog To be clear I will make this same argument for any star level player over a coach. It’s just silly especially in the NBA, a league with little parity throughout history where the best player or best collection of players almost always win.
@ShapDanny @jackfrank_jjf I just literally gave you an example of a player that almost never made it to the playoffs in 14 yrs. If they see 10x All Star, 3-4x All NBA, 5-7x All NBA Defense, ROY, DPOY, top 20-30 All Time in rebounds and assists, etc. the last thing that will be looked at is playoff success
Giannis once again cucking over superstars forgetting he just won an NBA title with no other star. Is a DPOTY and won back2back season MVPs.
@Jacobmorenonba The nba hall of fame is extremely easy to get into , If Ben keeps going at the pace he’s going with the all star games and first team all defenses he’s getting in easily
The Knicks are in a position where if the young guys get better our ceiling will get better. If RJ becomes the all star/all nba guy we say he is then that Larry o Brian trophy is coming sooner rather than later https://t.co/SsEqY1fZHP

2x All NBA Defensive First Team

@WoodyHuncho i think he can return to like all star form and maybe even all nba form because of what he can bring in the regular season depending on who his next team is, but i think this is who he is as a player more or less.

greater success for ben imo depends on the fit being jussst right
it is a team sport tho. they aren’t even in the finals if khris middleton doesn’t average 29 over the last 2 vs the hawks with no giannis.

They have a star on their team who’s value absolutely tanked if you watched the playoffs, who is under contract, and will never play for them again.

@DevaronPerry @ItsCavalier_Pod @KJG_NBA @JohnSuchan @AcrossCavs @cwmwrites @amadousow_ @BrownlojCLE @ArmchairQBDan @JustinMatch26 Kinda as a way to try to get sentiment of their side to make the Cavs make a choice 

In being honest I've seen one player with Garland's skilset become a star like the media has said 

His name is STEPH CURRY
@DevaronPerry @ItsCavalier_Pod @KJG_NBA @JohnSuchan @AcrossCavs @cwmwrites @amadousow_ @BrownlojCLE @ArmchairQBDan @JustinMatch26 I think the media has made Garland into a future super star .  I'm not so sure he has the all around game to be that with his limited athleticism and quickness 

I think they've made him j to that because if quite frankly a dislike of  Collin Sexton and/,or the small backcourt...
I'm saying it right now 
If Darius Garland isn't a super star by the end of year I'm raising hell on all those who said he would be 

It's not one excuse for him not to be .  I have my doubts but will happy to be proven wrong .

Keeping open mind 

Hurry up NBA season
@KJG_NBA @JohnSuchan The way I see it 

Garland very good passer (not quite elite), beautiful pull game , not bad defender .
 Trouble getting to rim vs elite defenders and not much else in arsenal offensively .
Only path to being a star is if he's Steph from outside nothing short
@adamchernoff YES!!!  Although the local venue would lose millions by people not staying til Monday. Super Bowl needs to be played Presidents Day weekend, where people are off on Monday ( I don't care if that is usually NBA All Star weekend.)

@Kmalikmusic @LegendOfWinning You're trading a superstar for another superstar, while retaining a young versatile star with superstar potential who's skillset would take 2-3 players to replace him. I don't think a 90s style offense running through a big can win in this NBA.

I’ve always thought Dray was criminally underrated by the casual fan during the GSW dynasty. *Shocker* that he was making all nba/star/defense teams despite criticism from fans… much like Ben… because shocker, defense matters.

Doesn’t mean you get to ignore his shortcomings.
Sorry but which of these players is Ben Simmons worse than?

All Star/NBA/Defense selections:
Wall: 7 in 11 years
Kyrie: 10 in 10 years
AD: 16 in 9 years
Bennett: 0
Wiggins: 0 in 7 years
KAT: 3 in 6 years
Ben: 6 in 5 years
Fultz: 0
Ayton: 0
Zion: 1
Ant: 0 https://t.co/6QGv3FJ9Ha https://t.co/e4pF47Qgc7
@usatodaysports @DanWolken He’s played 4 seasons, his team has made the playoffs 4 straight seasons, and he’s been all nba, all star, and all defense.

I wonder how NBA coaches view Ben Simmons. Specifically Tom Thibodeau. A 2 time All NBA defensive player, 3 time All Star at 25 years old. We need to stop acting like this guy is trash…
@nothinbutknicks @Sharonchik266 Randle is an MVP candidate. That justifies his worth. Ben was All NBA and 2X All Star and that justifies his worth. You keep trying to downgrade the accolades as if they don’t matter when it comes to how players are paid. Only reason why it’s failed, is because Ben wants out now.

@damanr I think a big reason it’s like this is with how regional baseball is in comparison to NBA’s star-driven fandom.

Youngboy is an angel. He’s the person I aspire to be, he’s my light of day. The way his music flows and sounds is extravagant and pleasant. Youngboy is an icon, a legend, my idol, a King, an inspiration, a STAR. I could go on and on, understand this. I Love NBA Youngboy.

@richmacleod @JCMacriNBA Knicks are excited about RJ and rightfully so. He has All Star potential and with the work ethic, he will get better. Also did you look at the Top NBA 100 from SI. He deserves to be on that list or at least an honorable mention.
@ChrisFedor Here it is Kevin Love, Issac Okoro, and two top 3 protected picks. Sixers get youth and an upside guy in Okoro. A Vet who can stretch the floor off the bench in Love. Cavs get a All star and all nba defender. Picks are big for philly. Fair on all sides and we keep Sexton.

Tyler got too much gas after the bubble

He got way too crapped on last season

Tyler is a good NBA player. His ceiling is fringe all star, but his floor is prolly very good 6th man, which is fine in itself 

Think he gets closer to his ceiling https://t.co/f046uDC25V

Luka is overrated…

Might go as far to say most overrated star in the NBA
@BarnesxROTY @Im_just_a_dud @TheNBACentral @AmicoHoops What is the fit there. The jokic-Murray 2 man game is one of the best and Simmons is significantly less impactful when he’s off-ball. Are you taking the ball out of Jokic and Murray’s hands and getting rid of a 6’10 young star who’s already one of the best shooters in the NBA?
@katszn_ One is a top 5 defender in the nba and just won a ring as a star and the other didn’t play a ton last year while struggling on a bad team

@Brandon_Kroger @MySportsUpdate Actually yea that's a great point, I wouldn't call Brandon Roy (NBA star) a bust even though he was consistently injured, he put up superstar numbers while active so it feels so wrong to call them busts just cuz it didn't work out.

@Majin002 @mashtimsnoc @HeatNationCom Is Draymond &gt; Butler? 

Butler hasn’t accomplished anything in the NBA compared to Draymond. His resume shits on him. Dray has broken playoff records, has been a valuable all star piece in 3 championship. He’s a DPOY!

Draymond MUST be better then Butler deductively right?
@FearTheBrown I’m just saying there is a list of Duke players that get to the NBA as so called star players but when they get out on the court with professional players The Big Dawgs they feel threatened and realize they have to compete to get to where these guys are it ain’t no joke

@SpencerKeele I mean, look at Steph and Luka. Both are top 6 players in the NBA (arguably better than Embiid), but didn't finish well in either the regular season or playoffs because they lacked a 2nd star to play alongside.

@Boluisapoet @nbalegacypod @HanaHoops @notorioustei He was shooting below 41% and below 32% percent from 3 by the time the all star game came around, if your going to shoot like thrash and be the worse defender in the NBA your not getting picked by the coachs.
@nbalegacypod @HanaHoops @notorioustei When did Kyrie decide to sit out 3 months? You don't put Booker and Trae two guys that can't even make the All star game last year as the first 12 for their conference over a guy who made the all NBA team
@J_guap4 Kyrie made the all star team, made all NBA and Trae didn't make the All star game in his hometown or make an all NBA team. Additionally if Kyrie wasn't hurt in 2020 Trae would have missed that all star game as well
@ThePack_OS @brooklynnets85 Don't know in what reverse world a player that plays the same position can make the All star team, the all NBA third team while the other doesn't make either and be ranked lower

@yO_____5L @cantguardaaron @mell0_yt @HoopMixOnly Kareem played against all star wilt. He was 7’1 and a top scorer of all time. The average height for NBA players were about the same in the 70s-80s as today. That argument makes no sense.
The league didn’t want Trae as an All Star or All NBA. 

Bet it won’t happen again thoooo
You gone be hard pressed to find an NBA star or superstar who doesn’t try to manipulate the refs &amp; get foul calls in some way shape or form.

@AlexMVZ21 @CarmichaelDave Wait, two times NBA champion and four time all-star (only three Kings all star appearances since 2004!) Rajon Rando, but a foot taller and stronger and faster? You’re right, we shouldn’t give up anything for him.
@humblehustlin Thats not true, Rondo dominate the game without shooting... a PG like that you just gotta have the right pieces around them... You been saying that since he been a all star but he still better than 80 percent of the NBA lol Dude still could be a elite pg
@TopTierCrown That’s how real nba all star has been to be fair

Until Trae and Donovan win something as the solo star they're no different. There's only like 6 guys in the NBA that can win big as THE guy so saying someone can't do that isn't the diss you think it is. Kyrie is way better if you have him with another one of those guys. https://t.co/Ab42E98uP2
@BillyReinhardt A year ago Simmons for Wall + picks would be laughed at by PHI fans and anyone really. Simmons + Maxey + others was seen as the best star package in the NBA. If that's what they end up being forced into it's a colossal failure by PHI (even if they now have to bc of Ben hold out)
Which is also why it makes sense to target future draft capital if you're trading a star, because that — rather than cap space — is the most valued NBA currency in the 2020s.

@knicksyanksrbny @espn @ESPNPlus That’s recency bias imo. Randle was better this season but overall we not gone act like siakam wasn’t also all nba second team last year, all star, had his team 2nd overall in the league and went further in the playoffs performing better while also being a much better defender.
@SunsfanTrey @GeraldBourguet Siakam die? All nba, all star, 2 option on a title winning team…
@DontGetSunburnt @ClipsLand @Baniya_tera_bap @spencergh2 Now if you wanna talk using your argument with accolades, pg won 6x all nba, 4x all defensive, 7x all star. 

Skill wise, the only thing book does better than pg is mid range shots, and that is their closest category. Pg the better 3pt shooter, defender by a large margin

@evrybodyhatesE To trade Simmons who, once again, just turned 25, a 3 time all star, all NBA defense and all around player… for a 27/28 year Brogdon who is a okay starter, no all star appreances, and injury proned… no one is making that deal
The ability of star players to drive revenue has as much to do with skill as it does with the NBA and the media to promote star players. With very few exceptions, if you play in a small market you will have a hard time "driving revenue." Does this mean you're less valuable?
@JoshEberley Booker is without question the single most overrated 'star' in the NBA right now.
@NBA @AschNBA Everyone chatting about the weight when the real issue is team leadership. 

If you want your star pick to succeed, find  players to motivate them. If he still folds then think about a change.

But are we really asking Zion to "do more" when he's averaging 27?
Steph and Dame really had a half court shootout in a nba all star game lol
@215To562 And it’s no insult the nba is littered with 20 plus ppg scores with high rebound or assist numbers who are yet or never have made the all star game ! One of the guys sixers want fox from kings hasn’t made one

The NBA product is in a bad place if a star player still on his rookie contract can repeatedly show up out of shape and get injured a lot, and the response from ESPN/rest of the media is to trash the GM (who, granted, hasn't been great) and try to get the player to the Knicks. https://t.co/WapYOHwmAX

LaMelo, at some of these prices, needs to be a repeat NBA Finals MVP and Hall of Famer basically

@wholelotabreesh @anstahh_ @Oscar__NBA @DailyKnicksFS I’m trying to understand the logic. 
The Timberwolves have had KAT for 6 years. 
They’ve made the playoffs once, coached by Thibs. 

This notion of rather having a star player and just getting a capable coach to make it work… how’s that worked out for the Timberwolves so far?

Magic should get a package for Ben Simmons, his value is so low right now but he’s a back to back all star with All NBA talent, thoughts Magic Nation?
@opinionsondanba Let’s just hope it doesn’t turn out like the 2007 NBA All Star Game weekend <U+0001F633>
@zKYLOx @thetruth_24 @Frankie_rotundo @SBondyNYDN No. Julius Randle (2nd team all NBA, All Star MIP) and RJ Barrett (upwards trajectory) is a good package for KAT. Nothing for them to turn their noses up at all. But go off.
@thetruth_24 @Vinny75020 @Frankie_rotundo @SBondyNYDN You mean the dude who just made all NBA second team and made the all star team at age 26 averaging 24 10 and 6 shooting 41% from 3? RJ leveled up to. You mention playoffs like KAT has done anything there before. That’s about as good of a package as they’ll get for him
@seanpmcg1 @MOConnor_NBA It’s not the contract. It really isn’t - $30m isn’t too much for a young All Star / DPOY candidate. It’s the assets to get him and a team that can fit the contract and his game.

@OGtheClampGod_ They are not comparable Ben Simmons is an all star, as much as I think he’s a stinker he deserves his accolades. Gary Trent Jr is just an average nba role player and he’s good at what he does. But he ain’t no Ben sorry, love Gary though.
@dom_nft @NBA Def think they should be contenders... championship pedigree + depth + star power are all there! I think Klay will be fine.
@october44 @MNSportsTalk247 @DaneMooreNBA @brittrobson Dave I feel like you should stick to hockey, because this is a horrendous take. Wiggins' contract was the worst in the NBA, to be able to get off that contract and get an all star player in return was nothing short of a miracle.
Most of the players from the 2013 all star NBA team are either playing for the nets or lakers… this is the softest league era in history of the NBA.

Seems like the NBA is coming to a point where some decisions are going to have to be made on what direction the league wants to go in. They have struggled with ratings and it seems like the current model where star players sign long contracts then ask out isn't working.

@S2ENSE_ @FlippNoBirdie @ShannonSharpe It's not slander. An all star, all NBA, All defense, max player can't get you buckets in close games in crunch time unless he's positioned in the post. That's limited for someone with his talent. Even he's on some Joker level point center type, he's not a threat to score.
@S2ENSE_ @FlippNoBirdie @ShannonSharpe You keep saying as if anyone else said it. Can't and won't are 2 different things.

@J1gg__ @Will44574743 Just my opinion, but two really good big men don’t get it done in today’s NBA. New Orleans had Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins, both in or near their crimes, and were quite underwhelming. I’m all for trading for a star, but not KAT, unless we got him on the cheap.

@PranavSriraman @realdealsniper @LottaHubris @Wadesburner And yes now I am glad I'm a Cavs fan but I hate when player get underrated just because their team is shit, this shouldn't be a thing in the NBA, every team has a good potential star and end up playing like an superstar or all star (Sexton) but become underrated cuz of their team
@UniqueMazique I remember back in the mid 90's. Around 96. In Houston it was Fundy League. Damon Jones came to play. Fam was out there looking like Dame Dollaz. I just knew he was going to be a star in the NBA smh.
@Amy_Siskind Remember HB2 in Charlotte, NC in 2016?  The NBA moved their All Star Game in 2017 to New Orleans, and basically told North Carolina that they'd return in 2019 if they got their act together.  And, they did.  Money talks.

@SIChrisMannix Thankfully. I had real fears for Bowe. He looked far worse and slower than Holyfield did in his training. Bowe fell on hard times (prob needs money) but why was an ex NBA star doing one of these shit-shows???
@CarmichaelDave I trust the guy who hasnt played a real game over the all nba defensive player and all star who is only 2 years older than previous player is certainly a take.

@jelynchjr Just Bench Ben Starting Maxi at this point is a much better option. Maxi will be a star in the NBA
@Crew_love0 And Tyrese Maxie is a better point guard then Ben ever was... Ben just dump and hide in the offensive  zone is pitiful... Tyrese is a threat to put up 30pts. And will be a star in the NBA

@4MR_Monty @1realpantherfan @BigCheeseTC He's played in Australia as well. He's a young NBA player with all the qualities to become a star. Basketball is a top 3 sport world wide. He's going to be the biggest name in Charlotte within the next 5 years.
@BigCheeseTC Lol some of the worst arguments I've ever seen made. Basketball is a top 3 sport in the world. If you become a star in the NBA you become one of the most recognized individuals in the world. MJ been out the game for almost 20 years and he's more recongized than Brady. lol

@whomartyp @TheTyJager Lol 2x MVP, 5 rings, 3x finals MVP, NBA All Star MVP, Naismith Player of the Year in college. The list goes on. If you rank Jordan over LeBron due to rings there’s no reason to not do the same here. The Big Fundamental is the best PF to ever play the game point blank period.

The most overrated thing by fans is cap space for a rookie contract star. Somehow max space means you’ll for sure get max players. But why would they go play with a 3rd year all star/all nba player with nothing else when they can go play with a vet star that guys will flock to?

However the Sixers desperate desire for a second superstar to pair with Embiid May have caused them to downplay the red flags with Simmons. The other problem is, the NBA is such a superstar driven league, that teams are far more easily held hostage when a big star wants out

Congrats to our friend @jj_redick on announcing his @NBA retirement after an epic 15-year run!

Curious what he’s up to next? @tim_katt and I had JJ on @thegameplanshow in Season 2 to talk about *exactly* that. Check it out: https://t.co/CwRFCKvpPk
@growup_dk @BR_NBA @SacramentoKings They even said it when he was drafted. He's called that because the star players for other teams would have a poor game when he was on them.
@TickPick A French NBA star named Rudy started a series of events that lead to the complete shut down of many sports all over the world https://t.co/seVVtWpPX1
@Clarson_97 He’s one of 22 players with 25k pts, 8 time all star, 2 time all nba
@Hawksrevengeszn @atlhawkstime11 He’s inevitably going to be the #1 option. I don’t see Randle as THE GUY in 2-3 years, even if he is the guy now. Randles great, but RJ’s improvements into an all star or all nba level player is what is going to make us true contenders.
@logosaetos @POPSUGAR @itsjojosiwa @JennaJohnson Transgender men are playing sports against girls cause they couldn't beat men. We can't have them feeling bad about themselves. Gay people can influence a who city. Bathroom bill in Charlotte called for the NBA to move the All star game cause they wouldn't let men in ladies RR.
@d00dbuffet @KendrickPerkins The fans?  Dude really. Did you watch any game at all. They cheered and encouraged a max NBA player who was scared to shoot a basketball.  He wasn’t booed.  Go back and take a look. Maybe you are watching too many of his workout videos against the ymca all star team.
@BigJones5577 @mommas_baby123 @ZachLowe_NBA Keep telling yourself KAT is a superstar, lmk how that works out. Jokic went to the playoffs prior to Jamal Murray being a star. James harden did it for years in Houston before getting a second star. Kawhi in San Antonio. Superstars make the playoffs regardless
@mommas_baby123 @ZachLowe_NBA Empty stats mean nothing and even the empty stats you provided don’t back up a superstar. A superstar is an all star starter almost every year, not getting into the game sometimes and making 3rd team all nba. He needed jimmy butler and thibs the only time he made the playoffs.

@xst05 @PhillyRolls @Bodenderbyshir3 @msquirrel20 @sharpalright The league would also step-in. The NBA doesn’t want star players to just stop showing up just because they don’t like their situation, they signed a contract.
@ZachLowe_NBA @BobbyMarks42 @JonKrawczynski It's hard to remember a star quiting on a team as hard as Simmons with that much time left on his deal.

Harden and Butler might be used as examples but they had less time and at least showed up to camp.

It would be like harden not reporting after the clippers game in 2015
@JohnWall @BabyBallersUS Does anyone know what this @JohnWall All Star Jersey is worth? #NBA https://t.co/oxuaDZpsJX
Something to keep in mind is that star players and their agents are forging the new path toward using trade requests in lieu of free agency. This doesn't help the majority of NBA players, who make up the most powerful voting bloc in the union.
@TalkinBaseball_ Maybe people were confused if it meant in one season or one game. Dropping 60 in basketball is impressive, but with almost everybody chucking up 3s and very little defense, scoring is a lot easier in the NBA now. Look at all star games, 160-150...

@RP3natural Naw but we have had a #1 overall draft pick, 2x 1st team All NBA Defensive Player, 3rd Team All NBA, multi-time All Star, top 15 in assists, that averaged 9asts, 9rebs, 2stls, &amp; 1blk per game in last season's playoffs. Now if Lemelo gone do that, bring him on. https://t.co/77a8HgMJBD

@NoTechBen I think the Blazers would do that in a heartbeat but Philly would never. Simmons is younger, cheaper contract, and made 3rd team all NBA while CJ has never made an all star team and quietly just had a poor playoffs, is injury prone, and a bad defender.

What? He's Still Being Paid By This Team? Steph Curry's Old Co-Star With The Golden State Warriors Is Still Being Paid By The Indiana Pacers - Sports Illustrated https://t.co/gffvG2gq7x
@JtheGreatest__ Don’t matter if they not treating him like that, his market value an All star so u dnt trade nun period in no business if u dnt get equal value back. And it’s both they fault cause his ass won’t improve his game and he got a whole bunch of yes men around him so it’s both parties
@JtheGreatest__ The problem is it’ll be different if they rebuilding but they ain’t they a top seed they tryna keep that u know. And like I said he an all star can’t trade him for no. And honestly maybe ain’t nobody offered nun cause he trade value so low dnt nobody believe in him no more
@JtheGreatest__ He not a bad player, he just mentally weak right now. They wanna get rid of him but u can’t trade nobody that’s an All star and not get nun good back. That’s bad business you know

@Determined_NBA Ah see that’s what I’m saying they not treating him like an all star. So In my opinion it’s the organization fault. They should’ve never let it go on and made a trade based off what was available then. Now you stuck in really bad business move. Finna be a bad season<U+0001F926><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>

I agree with this like don’t get me wrong THT seems like a cool dude but SUPERSTAR is such a strong word if you said All star game one day ok that would’ve been fine.

@TheRealHoarse @The_Barftender @itsjustTaj_ He’s an all nba player, 3x all star, 1st team all defense, and DPOY runner up. He’s only 25 and He’s definitely a star
@KGsGOAT Its hatd to leave out any of the guys i put if any probably magic tho but my reasoning was bill was the first and most succesfull star dr j was the merger MJ was the most popular and magic saved the nba from collapsong but youre right id probably take out magic for lebron
@russoj5 Two free agents swapping teams in a sign and trade over cap semantics is quite different than a star forcing his way to Boston for a reduced price. An All NBA player demanding Boston and torpedoing his trade market to get here has never happened.

@BBrennanNBCS Welcome to dealing with NBA players. A 25 year old NBA star is like dealing with a teenager. He knows everything and wants his ass kissed. If the 6ers ever want to win, the fans need to wake up to reality. No nba players want to play here. This isn’t the NFL.

@WittyAsCharged It is a million dollars, but a million dollars isn't worth as much house as it used to be.

@JCampo13 @jonjohnsonwip I agree that he’s not as good as those players, but he has a great resume so far. 3x time all star, multiple time first team defense and a third team all nba player and a rookie of the year. And his agent is Rich Paul. I think he will end up where he wants unfortunately
@mofongoluv @Trip53820192 @Dom_2k You think the 18x time all star 16 all nba 12x all defense 1x mvp 5x champ most 60 point games in a career 3rd all time in scoring when he retired
@IamKDiddy He hasn’t even played an nba game yet and Simmons is a 3x all star and 2x first team all defense player. As much as I like Mitchell this would be such an easy decision. He’s also only 2 years older than Mitchell
@kyweezybeeitch Yeah it's crazy I want to say Jim made an all star game or two or made an all nba team or two...

@bdetrick And klutch will keep releasing it weekly , because all these other weak nba teams have fallen prey to words , and let an agent rule their franchises with words,sixers can give Ben away and waste Embiids career, being average at best , or let him sit till a star becomes available
A lot of teams are going to be interested. He’s still young and got all the mechanics to be a star. Haters gunna hate, I don’t give af if you do just callin as I see it #NBA #bensimmons #76ers https://t.co/zfkEElbmKK
if any other player was…

26 years old,
averaged 24/10/6/1,
on 46/41/81 splits,
made all-nba second team,
had an all-star appearance,
and won most improved
while leading a team to the 4th seed without a second star…

@Kid_uno Youth+ picks might be the best we get and could set up a future deal but also this the NBA there's always another potential star disgruntled player waiting to be had. We gain nothing now trading him now or start of the season

@DerekBodnerNBA The Phillies and Sixers both spectacular botched rebuilds together, and wasted payroll flexibility along the way. If not for Embiid and Harper, it would be comical. Only difference is the star NBA player makes the Sixers at least relevant, and Harper’s presence only does so much.
@t_mcallister I need at least one current NBA star to just roast the shit out of him for this.
@PoliticalJM7 @musicandvoodoo @JamesSeltzer Trades in the NBA have to be for the same value so that money is spent either way. If you can't get an all star its better to make him sit. Can't be a star in the league on the bench

How can you say you are a pro (max ) player but can’t shoot outside 2 feet, letting ur team play 4 v 5 on offense, letting your star center gets doubled and tripled easily cause no one sees you as a threat! &amp; then you proceeded to shoot the worst FT % in the hstr of d NBA

Ben Simmons going to a team for a mid level starter to borderline star and a pick

Y’all ruined the value of a 1st team all nba defense player who hasn’t hit his prime
@wojespn @sixers should let him dry on the bench or trade him to the worst possible team. Tantrum child, unable to accept his faults. Has the @nba already noticed this pattern with each star represented by @KlutchSports?
Has there ever been a more mentally soft "all Star" in NBA history more then Ben Simmons?
That said, it's really stupid of an NBA franchise to play this game with Rich Paul. He has the ear of too many star players and future stars. Poisoning that relationship won't end well for them.
@wojespn Available: 6’10” point guard who can pass, but can’t shoot at all, mediocre defense, can’t shoot free throws, and clams up in clutch time. Also, considers himself a mega-star. Philly wants all the 1st round picks.

@EBomb_NBA Exactly. This is what happens when you throw your star under the bus and then light the bus on fire. Sixers undeniably better with Simmons, yet they treat him that way? Good luck, Sixers!
@Bill_GoIrish I mean they have a good team but I’d definitely be more entertained by a Yankees series the Toronto makes it all they will talk about is drake like the nba all star game that year
@aklingus You're not wrong but Morey can't give up Simmons for nothing.  Pelicans set the bar for what teams need to bring to the table to get an all star in return.  But I think they're both misreading the room with regards to Simmons market value.  If I was an NBA GM I wouldn't sign him.
@LakerCentral365 I think Portland…

Dame is wasting another year of his prime if he stays, and Portland won’t get an all star / all nba type of talent in any other trade. Dame is a seamless fit for Philly and, while Simmons isn’t perfect, he’s a young, talented player for portland to build with.
@ScottHoward42 He might be the only star PG in NBA history to go on the block that the Phoenix Suns will have had zero interest in acquiring. And to be clear, nor should they.

@disgame21 @Mohamoud9_ Spot on. Plus they shot themselves in the foot, he’s a two time all defence and is an all star plus all nba player and they said he’s the reason they lost and that he’s not a championship PG. What did they expect? They only have themselves to blame and Ben is absolutely justified
@kingthorfinn1 @YamiSanKev @wojespn Can’t call a 3 time all star and 2nd team all nba player garbage
Ben Simmons does not have as much leverage as your average all star player. I wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t get moved for months and just gets fined like his entire salary. Can’t be demanding shit if you a modern day Tayshaun Prince (still good just not all NBA)
@BillyBearkat @ATexanNamedRyan @HousTonXfan @RocketsNationCP He’s been an all star each year since his rookie year all nba once and will be a perennial guy on the dpoy ballet

@andlankell Typically deep playoff runs help boost players profiles, but somehow I doubt that NBA gives that much love to Hawks starting 5.

There're enough BIG 2's &amp; BIG 3's across NBA to push Atlanta's starters out of the top 60.

League sees Hawks as having 1 star &amp; bunch of nice players.
@manoffrm 100% because of the college angle. It might not happen first crack but eventually I think he gets in. Top 15 in 3’s made in NBA history. 0 all star appearances and no finals either definitely hurts him though but like I said with College I think it gets him in.
@ZCiavoPSN Everything you highlight still makes him an impact player. We would have won the NBA title with his impact and the teams defense and 3 point shooting. Rivers not only improved Danny Green but Seth and Tobias.....now you improve 20 points and 7 assist all star.  No brainer
@ZCiavoPSN Listen to you. Yes yes yes. Lol you are stating everything not only is Wall a five-time all star former NBA all defense. Through everything you said. He still averaged 20.6 points 7 assists. Still can defend. He played 40 games sat out most.  Ben 58 games. No brainer

@WalkWithLyle Allen Iverson demanded a trade too. Nothing happened he came back won All star MVP NBA MVP lead the league in scoring and took the team to the finals with 6 injuries including a broken tailbone
@s_hiburizu Even then, I still think the players from the largest entry should take home more money than organizers. Do team owners, coaches take home more than an NBA star? Sometimes yes, other times no and would likely be the same for the FGC and esports in general.
@NerdschleifeMF He’s a pro at tantrums already. I keep joking that he’s destined to be an NBA star based on his flopping skills.
Marshall University is set to dedicate a statue of trailblazing former star Hal Greer on Oct. 9. The former NBA star, who is credited with breaking the color barrier in West Virginia collegiate sports, played basketball at Marshall from 1954-58 averaged 19.4 points per game.

Not sure why he hasn’t improved but hopefully he can find the right motivation in Houston or anywhere else. There’s too much talent in him, even with his very obvious limits - he’s still at a star level in the NBA. 

Recency bias is why most people are playing with his name.
@JLewis562 No one will ever beat this season. Hakeem carried the rockets to that championship. He holds the NBA record for blocked shots, 3,830 and is the only player to record more than 3,000 blocked shots and 2,000 steals in a career. He’s also a 12 time all star https://t.co/sH9FjaFlcp

In the 2013 NBA Draft, the Cleveland Cavaliers would somehow again get the first overall pick, this would give the Cavs a perfect opportunity to give their rising star another piece to help- No.

They selected Anthony Bennett. Someone who was so terrible he was unplayable.

@padresfangirl @BenAndWoods Look at the NBA, star players dictate the coaching, the type of team that gets put together, they can ask to be traded etc. Star players have massive amounts of influence, the team has committed more to them than any coach or GM.

@gavinthomas2015 I used to frequently play pickup basketball games on Saturday mornings in a gym in Dallas with former NBA star Mark Aguirre.
@WrayXin @Harrison_Grimm @PompeyOnSixers In which of those areas is LeBron better than Magic fucking Johnson?

Dude was a two-time MVP and a Finals MVP by age 22 in a solid, star-filled era of the NBA.
I travelled all the way to NOLA in 2017 to watch the NBA all star finals I.e to see AD <U+0001F602>. He got MVP and I was so hyped <U+0001F97A>. He was with the Pelicans at the time.
@justgotdone1 @LevitatingWolf Jordan never won championships until he had help in the form of a 2nd star. That is how the NBA has worked historically with very few exceptions. 

And there is no justification as to why Hakeem should have won over MJ in 88.

He never got to play. He was a star in practice,every player said so. He continued to sit,never played. And then,follow his progress when he left Portland https://t.co/RrdCmUb0nx
Proof of how talented #NBA players are. Shabazz Napier was a reserve in the league but overseas is a star. Had 33 PTS + 4 AST. So many former #NBA guys go kill overseas. Lance Stephenson, Mario Hezonja, Nikola Mirotic, Jeremy Lin, and Greg Monroe to name a few. #Euroleague #Zenit https://t.co/rhSlLmXQf1
@Kawhi2SZN_ “Not wanting to play” isn’t an excuse for losing. If you play in the NBA you have to have sufficient desire to win. And the Heat being without a borderline star and a role player is nothing compared to the injuries that benefitted the 2019 Raptors and 2021 Bucks.
@FanMahome @freexander @DJWankee @TheNBACentral @SiriusXMNBA Yea sure.. dudes who suck don't get multiple all star selections. Make all nba and all defensive teams and runner up for dpoy awards.. log off

@FF00701 Fasho but.. he would take like 30 shots to get it. Look beyond dude, Kobe would usually shoot 45-50% of his teams shot as a whole. Tbh any star player in the nba can have those exact numbers if they had the green light to shoot as much as Kobe did.
@KnixFix @forevershinin @NBA_NewYork @carmeloanthony @mworthofgame So true! MSG is the toughest arena to defend in all of sports. Knicks are automatically-6 at home because star players continually drop career highs.. melo had one good year w/ Knicks because Tyson Chandler(DPOTY) picked up Melo’s Slack that year
@NBAReactz @ThereChiGoes top to bottom that’s where the hawks excel lmaooo they have the deepest roster in the NBA, thought u would’ve said star power bc that’s the only advantage boston has really, that and probably defense, hawks have more shooting, better rebounders, better bigs and guards
@BuiltDiffy @LegendOfWinning I mean jokic is one of the best passers ever. If you were gonna have a problem with anything he just said maybe it’s the all nba signs part but I 100% agree mpj will show the signs and be in all star convo this year. 24+ ppg 7.5 rpg on 48/41/86 splits is my prediction

Think normies
@KieferEdwards @UNLVRebelGrl @jesse_1926 @Rob_Sellers_ @TArceneaux21 Geez you guys are amazing.  By now he committed to Houston.  It was his chance to play for a former NBA coach that took his team to the Final Four. And the Sweet 16.  And has had 4-star athletes before. And is adamant he doesn’t want 1and done.  Passed on several of them.

Thing i hate about today’s nba is. Not many players are as SKILLED as the OG’s . These players 95% raw talent and genetics. It’s not because they went got it and worked for it. All star games show you how unoriginal these players are. They not skilled like they used to be

@BleacherReport Don’t care he’s on the team with the laziest players in the nba. Dude was a bum at 6 2 then grew to 6 10 and became a star. Cousy, Heinsohn, Russel, Havlicek, bird, pierce Tatum all are where they are cause of hard work
@SmithLathan @HKhan2K @Nezzzooooo Imo that’s the second greatest team in nba history but that’s cause of how deep that team was since Larry elevated all his teammates. If lebrons on that team mchale, parish all take a lesser role. If we are looking at the team without the star what would get more wins

The nba sucks now more than ever. It doesn’t matter if you have young talent or not. If your team has a young star, like luka, Tatum, or even Giannas, there’s such a high chance you lose them to a super team it makes watching the games way less fun. free agency used to be great

@BobbySm31186296 @KySportsRadio Since 2015, what has Cal done to be in a Final Four? Does he get the kids who are 1 star or 2 star and turn them into legends at UK? No. That's what our tradition is. Not #1 recruiting classes to get players to the NBA. That doesn't win championships.

@paytonisnotroll Lakers now have a combined

5x MVP
50x All NBA
5x Scoring titles
58x All star appearances 
32x All defensive teams #LeSuperTeam.
If I remember correctly (and since we know both Sarah &amp; Todd blew some white supremacy dog whistles in their day) one of these drunken family brawls happened right around the time the story broke about Sarah's college coke fueled infidelity with an NBA star.... https://t.co/vmZieNPq6p https://t.co/0WQmXBSiP8

Sounds like whining to me. Do your job.  https://t.co/sOic94FQvJ
@bigsznsports @Serge03x @untuckedkai @TheJManJBT You can’t not be an all star ‘anymore’. You may not be at an all star level, but if you were an all-star in the past, that goes down in your NBA achievements. That’s like saying MJ ain’t an all star anymore based on what you’re saying.

@picks_primo @Casey_Viera Debatable. Again,  Simmons for all is flaws is a superstar, all nba, all world defender, all star. We only hope that Lonnie, DJ and/or Derrick can make it to one all star game. And as long as we keep Keldon, Vassell and we have 11 more guards, plus Maxey, i dont think so
What happens when #Kobe, two other NBA All-Stars, and Donald Trump all share an elevator?

@RustyJakWagon @PackripEwing @nbatopshot @NBA I’m guessing the lebron 3 and Edwards rising star dunk is coming up as well
My professor mentioned that what if we had like a mixed all star game, like with the NBA and WNBA? I think that would be cool if both teams had both that would be dope.

Happy 53rd birthday to #NBA Hall of Famer Toni Kukoc!

Michael Porter Jr. said the Kings almost took him second in the 2018 NBA Draft <U+0001F633>

He talked on J.J. Redick’s podcast about his crazy pre-draft process:

@celticsforum You are delusional,  no young nba star wants to come to boston.  The weather sucks, the nightlife sucks and everyone thinks the white folks are racist.  Tatum will leave when he can.  Zion will not come here.   Sorry to burst your fantasy bubble.
BE THE HARDEST WORKING PERSON YOU CAN BE.  That’s how you separate yourself from the competition.

@msjnba @btoporek 1. A trade on how Spurs would get Simmons and would it be worth it 

2. How should the NBA go about in adding a tournament mid season/ throughout the season 

3. Who on the Spurs roster has all star potential
@elitemafia2021 @PBS Jordan has 5 nba mvps, 6 finals mvps and 14 all star selections. Messi has won the ballon d'or 6 times in a sport with a far greater talent pool. You are out of your mind if you think Brady is even in the conversation with these two.
