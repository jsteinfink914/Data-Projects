@jordandan53 He led the 80s in scoring in the NBA and Jokic and English played in two different eras so the stats thing is hard to compare. The MVP certainly does put him on English’s level but I don’t think he has passed him just yet. Just my opinion though.
Luka on Being The  MVP Frontrunner:

“I don’t care about that. That’s at the end of the season all I care about is winning a championship with my teammates,” says @luka7doncic.

@BeardisGoat @nba_philly @DerekBodnerNBA If he didn’t get injured last year he could have won mvp the stats back it up
James Harden is my favorite NBA player. He was magnificent after coming over from Houston. Right up until the injury, he was the MVP according to most experts and myself.
Hey everyone

Just a reminder that Alperen Sengun is now in the NBA and won MVP of the 3rd best league in the world at 18

Have a great Monday!

@daddydoncic @SWlPATHEFOX @TheNBACentral @_Talkin_NBA Unaggressive and poor scorer are both things that can be improved upon.  If he was aggressive he could be an MVP level player (See: Sixers vs Jazz with Embiid out)

He won't though because he just wants to be rich and famous, not be great.

@TheNBACentral @_Talkin_NBA I don't care because I am the MVP
If Embiid can play closer to 70 games this season there’s a good chance he could win MVP. Especially if Simmons is gone. Will have to do it all for the Sixers on both ends of the floor. #NBA #Sixers
@montgomeryflim @Ihaveadisease1 @john1083749108 @RoseCityFTW @TheNBACentral @Alex__Schiffer Kyrie in that second round went against the bucks. The bucks that had the best record in the nba and the mvp. They just  won a title. The Celtics without Kyrie did not play the best team in the nba and MVP. So how can you compare years when they played different teams?
@Hoopassion @pgyoungfly @justbirane @JustRyCole That's not a sweep. So next time make sure you get it right so you look a little less dumb. The Celtics with Kyrie lost in the 2nd round 4-1 to the bucks. The bucks that had the best record in the NBA and the MVP. Kyrie was the only allstar on the Celtics. No Shame in that
@Hoopassion @pgyoungfly @justbirane @JustRyCole Without Kyrie did the Celtics play the team with the best record in the nba and the MVP ? If not , then why are you comparing when they didn't play the same competition with and without him. How does that make sense in your head ?
@McfcKDB_ @brookshuncho2 @MauUprising @Patsandbball @LeGeneralJ @onlytaron @TheHoopCentral You are ignorant of context. The bucks were the 7th seed when the Celtics beat them. When Kyrie played them in the 2nd round, they had the best record in the nba and MVP. Which means they got a lot better. That shouldn't be rocket science. So you're judging him off one year?
@C1376326315 @pgyoungfly @justbirane @JustRyCole Your ignorance is impressive. They won the games with Kyrie having those stats. Then they lost in the 2nd round to the bucks. The bucks that had the best record in the nba and MVP. Winning isn't automatic. Curry just missed the playoffs. LeBron just lost in the first round https://t.co/5QLxQ8O33j
@McfcKDB_ @brookshuncho2 @MauUprising @Patsandbball @LeGeneralJ @onlytaron @TheHoopCentral So you're judging Kyrie based on one year with a team he was traded to when he was the only allstar on that team that year. Hayward was coming off a terrible injury. Tatum in his 2nd year. Brown in his 3rd. They lost to the bucks with the best record in the nba and MVP.
@C1376326315 @pgyoungfly @justbirane @JustRyCole The Celtics did not play the team with the best record in the nba and mvp without Kyrie. They did with Kyrie. That context matters cause they didn't play the same opponents. So it doesn't matter what they did the year before if they not playing the same competition
@marvgoated @SulloReport @hakimbristel22 @Original_Gio They had a winning record with him fool. They lost earlier in the playoffs cause they played the team with the best record in the NBA and the MVP -bucks-   Why are you continuing to be this ignorant ? The Celtics were not loaded. They were good with Kyrie.
@pgyoungfly @Hoopassion @justbirane @JustRyCole Who said they sucked? Find me a tweet that says that. I bet you can't. Kyrie was the only allstar on the Celtics going against the bucks that had the best record in the NBA and the MVP. Those are facts. Not my opinion. They lost to a better team.
@marvgoated @SulloReport @hakimbristel22 @Original_Gio They looked worst with him based on what?  Did the Celtics play the bucks when they had the best record in the NBA and the MVP in the playoffs with or without Kyrie ? If they didn't play them with and without Kyrie , then why are you comparing when they didn't play the same team https://t.co/zefbdJBYK1
@pgyoungfly @Hoopassion @justbirane @JustRyCole How am i talking like that? Are you just imagining shit in your head ? I said Kyrie was the only allstar on the Celtics. That's a fact. I said the bucks had the best record in the nba and the mvp. That's a fact. So why are you putting extra shit i ain't say? I know what they did https://t.co/XwCAD5C7xZ
@chuckguarantees @marvgoated @SulloReport @hakimbristel22 @Original_Gio What was the point in your tweet ? Did you just want to say something that contributes nothing ? The bucks had the best record in the NBA and the MVP. The Cavs did not. Add something more insightful to the conversation next time
@NYKfan10304 @STUDYTHEGOAT @ClippersNets You think based on what? Embid just lost to the hawks in the 2nd round. At least when Kyrie lost in the 2nd round to the bucks, the bucks had the best record in the NBA and MVP and Kyrie was the only allstar on the Celtics that year. So you think based on what?

@TheNBACentral @SNYNets How long until this guy gets a vote for who is the NBA's MVP? THIS is why I don't esteem those awards.
The vaccination conversation in the NBA about to get real annoying quick. Wish they would stop reporting on that bs, and keep it about the game. Talk about early MVP candidates, NBA Final prediction… anything but that.
If Jokic wins MVP, I will say that he’s the best big man in the league and I’ll cop a jersey. @nba @TheNBACentral @RTNBA
@limonadeking @limonaleigo_ Curry: 2 Mvps, 3 NBA Champs, 0x FMVP, 4x All Nba first team, 0x all-nba defense first team

Kobe: 1 MVP, 5X Nba Champs, 2X FMVP, 11x all-nba first team, 12x all nba defense first team

Curry? not top 12 in my books
@sixandzero23 @codyslot @OfficialLeoWavy @trey_ming @_OmarAGonzalez @lamxmgmt Season and playoffs, they both balled out. Finals, WCF and finals, LeBron was most definitely the MVP. Nearly averaged a 30 point triple double. That was obvious to anyone watching, including the panel of NBA analysts who awarded LeBron MVP.
@defodeleting @RedxRonnie @RustyBUCKETS321 How was someone suppose to react when they lose a mvp title? Specially after putting those numbers? Lol 
Saying i didnt deserve to lose is now called downplaying? He just stated facts. The nba rewards are narrative based
@itsjwills Certainly not, but at the same time you cant assume he stays at the same level. Don’t get me wrong, I love Giannis, but anything can happen to where his performance dips. He needs 1 more DPOY, ring &amp; Finals MVP, 7 more All Stars and All NBA, &amp; 5 more All Defense to even compare.
1988… The greatest MVP race in NBA history. MJ beat off Bird, Magic, Barkley, Drexler, Nique, The Dream, and The Mailman averaging…
35 PPG
5.5 RPG
5.9 APG
3.2 SPG
1.6 BPG

@LukaUpdates Put so much talk about the man when he achieve nothing yet in NBA after his rookie year. Regard his as mvp, best player, etc when he never make it to second round. Its not doubting luka, its just disrespecting other players
@itsjwills Ok, so age 27 Giannis &gt; age 27 Hakeem.  But Hakeem ended his career with an MVP, 2 titles, 2 Finals MVPs, and 2 DPOYs, plus was a 12 time All Star and 6x NBA 1st team.  Giannis has not matched Hakeem's career yet.

JJ Barea is 5"10. He was a key player on the 2011 Mavs Championship team. So it makes ZERO sense to me that former MVP candidate Isiah Thomas cant get a job. I am so disappointed that my Warriors passed on him. The NBA is is treating him like they did Nate Robinson. https://t.co/QIBmt0B4g8
@yossyol Westbrook won MVP on a gimmick. Its only 1 goal in basketball. Thats win. Kawhi led his team to 2nd best record in the NBA. Harden was also more deserving of that MVP over Westbrook. Nice meme but talk facts to me.

NBA 2021-2022 MVP Award goes to… TRAE YOUNG of @GoatedMarino Warriors! https://t.co/LapQxd4GTA
@KOT4Q Bulls 2022 champions, Zach LaVine gonna win the dunk contest, 3 point contest, MVP, MIP, be selected to all nba first team, be an All-Star and All-Star MVP and somehow win rookie of the year
@NBA_NewYork @drose @J30_RANDLE @TylerRelph10 You have to credit Rose man, he's sustained a career ending injury many times and has overcome those odds by reinventing himself, mind and spirit. He's arguably a more efficient/smarter player than MVP Rose imo.
I've said I have Randle finishing 3rd in MVP voting this year... I might move him up a spot... or two...

@JustTalkWrestle Reminds me of that time in 06 when MVP was burned alive by Kane and had to wear a bandage around his adominal area for a few weeks.
zions gonna be mvp for this nba szn and im confident in betting a grand for it
@KOT4Q Bulls NBA champions, Lonzo Ball finals MVP
@KOT4Q Derrick rose wins the 2022 NBA MVP
@edmerbrito @MLBONFOX @RhettBollinger My point is all those NBA fans that said Curry didn't deserve the MVP even though he has the best stats of all players because GSW were not a top 4 seed.  So in MLB you don't need to be a playoff team.
@MLBONFOX @RhettBollinger what else do you expect from Trout he just pushing a teammate.  Angels record makes Ohtani not a MVP or Curry should have been MVP in NBA.
@Alwaysn4evaArt He has 6 all nba first teams and was a top 3 mvp finalist 5 out the last 7 years. Ppl just be on here talkin dawg <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>
@warriors Bet you didnt expect to far exceed your own expectations &amp; you're just getting started!

@RobbScott7 @Sportsnet @michaelgrange @loung_s Right but your initial statement is wrong. Siakam can be the man. Siakam has the skillset and talent to be anything he wants.. mvp? All star? All nba? 1st option? 2nd option?? He can be it all<U+0001F971><U+0001F971> so claiming he cant be that option is false
@deckkkard @Raptors @pskills43 Pascal siakam would be an MVP and a 2022 NBA champion *hint hint*
@AD2022MVP__ Melo has came 2nd for MVP and has been all NBA 6 times. Chill tf out
@TravisGarber5 @PhillyMerk @robbie_deason @MLB @Angels So if you give him mvp this year. Do you continue to give him mvp even though other players might dominate batting or pitching? Because the nba doesn’t give Westbrook the mvp every year and he does everything
This isn’t even including ROY, ALL NBA 1st team (2x), ALL STAR(2x) Top 5 in MVP voting (2x) <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602> https://t.co/duaRPv4EYz

At first glance this seems absurd. Think about it for a sec and it's a legit question. Luka had a Euroleague career BEFORE the NBA and he was MVP of that league https://t.co/7gKOWq8CIF
@russgoat4 He's only been in the NBA 3 years but his euro league career is included bro.  He was MVP of the euroleague. It's the Basketball hall of Fame not just the NBA hall of Fame. I wouldnt say he's a hall of famer just yet though.
@hoodieskeenasz Lmfao I basically said the SAME THING to him.  It's so absurd that fans have the audacity to claim that ANY NBA PLAYER has a "low basketball IQ". It's sound downright stupid when someone on Twitter says an all star or mvp and hall of famer has a "low iq".  It's so dumb bro lol
Haven't done enough??

@mvp_EtHaN @BenStinar Didn’t know that was NBA history
@MLB @MikeTrout @Angels The playoff arguments don’t work in baseball. Individual MLB players don’t have the same impact like they do in the NBA/NFL. The MVP is valuable to baseball not just their team. Ohtani is doing things never before seen in the history of baseball. He is the first 6 tool player.
Julius Randle was literally voted as one of the top 10 players in the NBA last season (All NBA 2nd team and a top 10 MVP finish) lol. Keep calm and carry on https://t.co/ugKdxiCBYQ
@creamcheeseboi @MrChuckD @NBA @DetroitPistons So you’re comparing the 1 league MVP a media vote award to B2B NBA Champions and another Championship team that had B2B Finals appearances? Championship teams that beat Jordan, Bird, Magic, Kobe, Shaq? Again that’s a terrible comparison.
Can we get new MVP rewards in the upcoming season? I’m at 981k already without playing much nba, kinda makes mvp points useless after penthouse @Ronnie2K @Beluba @NBA2K
@KDOthecoolkid @MrChuckD @NBA @DetroitPistons He’s the MVP of the nba but he’s not a giant part of their marketing or hype video shit throughout the summer, just as the pistons.
@MrChuckD @NBA @DetroitPistons Seeing the same thing happening to jokic’s MVP
@16_30rip @lelandray7707 @dennistlin @extrabaggs ...and that's the damn problem! Compare that to the NFL, NBA, and NHL. The MVP is usually a player whose team makes it to the postseason.
@ChairmanFrog Super star NBA player. You need a league mvp or at least a finals mvp in MY book
Your end of bench nba player will win MVP in almost every country talk less Ben Simmons. Stop it ! https://t.co/aTccrGjZmS

@BlazersBetta Damian Lillard is also not a 2 time mvp, or 3 time nba champion.
Our best player is an NBA most improved winner, defensive player of the year, all-star mvp, 2x league mvp, finals mvp, and champion. But that's ego. Presently, he's still just 26. #Giannis #Bucks #FeartheDeer https://t.co/TFeQPKpAyV https://t.co/Gf02FPSD8x
@lebronFM5Pszn @NBAGHOST23 @bao_noone @sixandzero23 @Jae_Lovesu @HardenSzn1 The media protects and coddles jordan unlike any other NBA player ever, the fact that he got MVP votes in 95 just shows how much of a bias they had for him and just automatically gave him that DPOY and the 10x all defence when he wasn’t a 10 time all defensive caliber guy
@Stayhumble_east @BiasedHouston that bad player went to the CF with warriors and won mvp of the league that year and is one of the NBA best scorer and lead the nba in assists in 17 and scored 50 4times back to back with just being a iSo ScORer and luka wont win a playoffs series
@NorthernGalaxy3 Luka has been an MVP candidate twice in his three year NBA career as well. He has also averaged 24 PPG, 10 AST, 10 REB, 1 STL, and 1 BLK throughout his Olympic career so far while leading Slovenia to a 16-1 record(+/- of +12.8) while he’s been apart of the men’s national team. https://t.co/ylhWdmMnH4
@Outkassst @RandomAhhJhit @BuzzBlockhead @JoshEberley You can say they stumbled the first year as it was unclear who the top dog was but Wade made the conscious and correct decision to let LeBron be that guy. The man already went to the Finals and won an MVP. It takes some serious balls to say he didn’t have any by then.
@mcsbxckup He has a nagging injury but is a better player now than he was before that Warriors series. He won a Finals MVP and then signed a max deal with his hometown team who instantly became a contender. Would you call that ruined? But I still call that cheap play getting Zaza'd though.
@sdlopex Not one of them is a great defender, so it might be Dame <U+0001F62C>

I know it's hard to believe Luka is this good this quick but he's coming off his second All-NBA 1st team. A distinction Dame has only had once. He's putting up numbers similar to LeBron's first MVP season.
@mcsbxckup He won a Finals MVP after that...
@aRoseCLE216 @PTStephD @Outkassst @BuzzBlockhead @JoshEberley I think you have a Cleveland bias here and this is a question for the world as a whole. Not what is right. What comes to mind for people in general. When the 24M people in southern California picture LeBron, it may be in purple and gold hoisting a Finals MVP.
Anybody that watches enough basketball can see that Jalen Johnson is an incredible athlete

You can also see that what you are witnessing is NOT a 48" vertical

There was a show in Atlanta called the 2 live strews

They had Charkes Barkley on for an interview

One of the hosts asked Charles Barkley if he was in the Hall of Fame

According to the published requirements, that individual would have the qualifications to vote fot NBA MVP https://t.co/EQxqlrTbnD
Sir

NBA players do NOT vote on the MVP<U+203C>

You are discussing the NBA ALL-STAR GAME

I did not mention the ALL-STAR game

I mentioned the MVP voting

If I had wanted to mention the all-star game I could have just as easily done so

You know that... https://t.co/6oLJTTVgVy
Ok

We're not talking about her defense

We're talking about eligibility to vote for NBA MVP

Is it true or not true, that if she participates in sports broadcasts she would meet the qualifications to vote for NBA MVP

May not be selected, but would be recognized as "qualified." https://t.co/1G7KCivle7 https://t.co/Z7OBm2atKe
People talk about sports on this app every day

According to that publication, the thing that excludes people on this app, who talk about sports everyday, from being eligible to vote for NBA MVP is the fact that they do not have media credentials

Tell me if I'm wrong
@PotatoLoose one of my favourite guys to watch in the league. one of the smoothest and funnest guys to watch when on fire in NBA history. my personal pick for Dark horse to win MVP next year

@DjDaDawn You must have forgot how good Cousins was before he got hurt. He did all of that you're giving Jokic credit for, minus the mvp jokic won in a season every star was hurt. Cousins also was stuck on one of the most horrible run franchises in the NBA.
Pretty sure B*yce H*rper has been doing this all year in the Phillies clubhouse yet all your hear about is his MVP caliber second half! https://t.co/YNyjdgIHuM
i don't want to hear anything about how the leading nl mvp candidates got hurt or he didn't play enough games. this bs happened with joel in the nba, it shouldn't happen to bryce. this team was dead in the water and now they're a game our of first place don't be dumb https://t.co/3jZTxVrv1C

@NorthernGalaxy3 so I suppose he could get in but euro league accolades aren’t no where near as impactful as NBA accolades. I believe he’ll have to get atleast 1 ring and/or MVP to reach the HOF level
@RustyBUCKETS321 Jayson Tatum will be the 2022 NBA MVP
@11xdeez @ChagNba @Bron23SZN First of all he wasn’t not leading the mvp race. If he was it was one week because they used update it every week. Second of all he russel Westbrook was the assist  champ. Harden didn’t even qualify to make an all nba team
I told that bitch, I ain’t no 2011 NBA MVP….but my D ROSE <U+0001F60F>
Indubitable top 5 players in NBA history in no particular order:

1. Michael Jordan (obviously) 
2. Bill Russell (11 rings makes Brady look like a chump) <U+0001F48D> 
3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (best name on this list and most MVP’s)
4. Wilt Chamberlain (scored on and off the court)
5. Lebron
@CoryWasHere22 Lmao ur dead tryna tell me that a 3rd team all nba guard is close to an mvp
@RustyBUCKETS321 The Lakers will win the 2022 NBA finals and Russell Westbrook will be Finals MVP
Lakers were winning the 2020 championship bubble or not. Clearly the best team in the NBA the whole year and LeBron was playing at a MVP level (should have won MVP) all season. Lakers lost there starting PG for the playoffs and still ran through. 5-5-5-6.

@DameSZN_ @DepressedKaiFan Accolades are used to measure a players’ greatness. If you ignore those… how else would you measure? 
Russ has not only been an MVP but has been an ALL NBA first teamer 3 times.
That means he was the best player at his position 3 times.
Kyrie has yet to do that.
@Celtics32287699 @EarlyDreDay @LeBronfactcheck The Heat were not more talented than the 1996 Bulls. You are sadly mistaken kid. 
96 Bulls: MVP, 2 All NBA 1st teamers, 3 All defense 1st teamers, COY, 6MOY, rebounding champ. 2 top 5 MVP candidates. 2 all stars. 
No one comes close
@DameSZN_ @DepressedKaiFan Westbrook is an MVP, 2 time All NBA first team, 9 time all NBA teams, 2 time scoring champ, 3 time assist champ.

Kyrie - 0 MVP, 0 All NBA first teams, 3 all NBA teams, 0 time scoring champ, 0 time assist champ.

Not close
@truthfulheatfan @CatMaster19951 There has been multiple Euroleague MVPs who didn't make the HOF while not one NBA MVP hasn't made it
@Matt_Of_ATL @truthfulheatfan @CatMaster19951 Well he had a crazy Euroleague career and was in MVP conversations in the NBA so he could make it as is

@Tmoney9101112 @FutureNBA0wner I was interested, so I looked into it. Rose's vote came from the fans - not the media. I'm guessing either Knicks or Chicago fans had some sort of "stuff the ballot box for Rose" thing going for him. That's sweet, but it's not a legit MVP vote - sorry.

@Celtics32287699 @EarlyDreDay @LeBronfactcheck Celtics were more talented in that era bc of the competition Lakers 76ers  etc. The watered down 90s was so weak Olajuwon won a championship without an All defensive or All NBA teammate. Jordan dominated the expansion era with a super team MVP 2x DPOYS 3all nba 3 all defensives
@sixandzero23 @nbarealist23 @Scottypippe_n @NBA4Jonathan @bronhistory Paul Pierce was the FMVP when he won his 1 <U+0001F644> now put him with a MVP DPOY 9x All NBA and 12x All defensive player like KG and a historically great shooter like Ray Allen as well as All defensive players Tony Allen and Rajon Rondo LeBron had no All NBAS or All defensive players
@HomeDepot420 @MissNaya00 @nightdrive82 @klayphe @StephenCurry30 He never played with another MVP or DPOY. The NBA HOF is overrated Chris Bosh and Tracy McGrady are in All NBA All defensive DPOY MVP scoring champion etc are more telling

To be honest, I don’t think I can point to one thing Nikola Jovic (the 2022 prospect, not a mis-spelling of the current MVP) does well on defense.

However, at 6’10” with as much perimeter talent as he has, and no true offensive weakness, he can be special. Easily top 10 for me.

@NBA @JoelEmbiid Difference between Simmons and Embiid. Humility. This guy worked every yr to get better and was almost mvp. He’s coachable. Simmons always thought he’s good enough. Resting on your laurels gets you traded.
@ImaHooper19 None of these players have gone 1-6 in the 4Q of a Game 7, in the NBA Finals, at home, after being the first unanimous player in NBA history, go 73-9 with a DPOY, Finals MVP, and a guy that can score 37 in one quarter as teammates.... and still lose.

That player?

@MrChuckD @NBA @DetroitPistons I think the Pistons are the only championship teams to not have an MVP winner on it (current, former or future MVP). Great teams overall, but maybe that's part of why. No transcendent players in their eyes. I love my Pistons though.
@JoshEberley I think that would be Barkley.  We was the MVP with the Suns, made a NBA Finals with them, but had some really good years with the Sixers in the 80s.

@manyfacegod35 @emanuelgodina @LeBronFactory because you're trying to downplay LeBron by bringing up teammates when it's obvious they achieve nothing without him. None are even remotely close to being 4 time mvp or playoffs all time leading scorer. He has more 1st all nba teams than all of them combined too. FMVP every time

@mallery33 @NetsSzn1 @STR0 Not better if the situation was flipped. Baseball players can’t carry teams to wins like NFL and NBA. Way more of a team game.  Using wins as a reason to disregard Sotos resume for MVP is dumb. I think him and Harper are really close and it could go either way.
Idk how underrated a former MVP can be https://t.co/TBI7ajVg8f

@CBAMavs @BibsCorner Luka entered the NBA as a EuroLeague champ/MVP, won NBA RoTY, and has been in the NBA MVP conversation from Day 1, whereas Dirk was unjustly considered a "soft jump-shooting Euro" until well into his peak... Luka has to live up to expectations, whereas Dirk had to defy them.
@overtime @Dame_Lillard Dame if you don't leave after this year, you might end up becoming a Gilbert Arenas in NBA all time lore. Why work this hard and have NOTHING to show for it. No MVP, no chips, nothing. Do better for your career my guy @Dame_Lillard
@Hypeman_OV @JamesEdrick3 @TheHoopCentral Smh wth you looking at stat wise of course kd is better he been in the league longer but Giannis H2H w/ Kevin who is better he proved it already he won the chip and has 2 mvp Defensive player 3 straight 1st team all NBA, finals mvp and ESPY AWARDS @ age 26

@IcyEmbeast @KarthikSab45 @alsouqi_omar averaged 10 points but also mention that he’s arguably the best defender in the nba, one of the best passers in the nba, and he rebounds. Joel also had Tobias averaging 20 and 10 damn near. And part of the reason he didn’t win MVP is cause the 76ers were so good without him
@KarthikSab45 @IcyEmbeast @alsouqi_omar Nuggets have the MVP and way better better coaching. Not to mention Dame only had one of greatest playoff performances in nba history and got no help from his team. Embiid should be able to beat the Hawks in a Game 7 at home. And Embiid Been on way better teams
@alex_lucero21 @Denzel30347352 @MarcelasHoward The guy who had a better season than his last mvp season? The guy who played through injury? The guy who’s team was 1-7 without him with?

@NBA_Skits Wanna see what a Finals MVP looks like?
@ShaggySquid @capguarantees I don't know if you saw my other reply, but I think that D Rose was straight up robbed from his prime, Boogie still had a decent go in the NBA and it looks like he's somewhat like his past self. Rose was the youngest MVP and basically was the best player in the east other than <U+0001F451>
https://t.co/8LFqkPhwgA on this podcast we tell the truth. We talk about why MVP Rose possibly couldn’t be a top 15 in today’s league. #nba #derrickrose #mvp #bulls @chicagobulls @drose @NBA https://t.co/vHbm6MlXYl
@MTL396 @Pusha650 This is 2021 for you, softest era with biggest excuses. These two teams are by far the most talented rosters the NBA has ever seen 1-12. Lakers have 2 former MVP’s as do the Nets. They each have 5+ former all stars. Don’t be one of those people.

Without Kawhi either him or Embiid for MVP https://t.co/XgkqwnkiCo
Bob McAdoo had an MVP, two second place finishes, was a 2x NBA champion and was a 3x scoring champion.  

Other players to have done that (or better) 

Jordan
Wilt 
Kevin Durant

That is all.
3x NBA Champion and 1x Finals MVP Dennis Johnson was born on September 18.  (RIP)

Took him 20 years to get into the Hall of Fame.
@warriorscore @kareempuntwomen @UnderdogCurry @BullsGotNext Scoring is everything in the nba nowadays. You can average 30 with worse all around stats and still win MVP nowadays as opposed to a guy who averages 25 but closer to a triple double. What a said league
Bold predictions 

Jazz finishing 65 or more wins

Rockets would be on play in

Jayson Tatum would be top 5 Nba mvp candidates

Kemba on Knicks wouldn't last long

Another Bucks vs Nets on Playoffs
@BullsGotNext One's an NBA champ, a two time MVP, Finals MVP and DPOY, Giannis over Harden anyday.

@Benzene21 @mtascavage @casualtakeking LeBron has the most unique build in NBA history, resulting in historic durability. But even he’s lost two first team all NBAs (2019 and 2021) and an MVP (2021) to injury because he’s has had so much wear and tear on his body in his 18 year career.

Those arguing DRose did not deserve MVP did not watch a single Bulls game that season. DRose was the best player on the court in each game he played in the regular season.
@Gunslinger127 @323Harden @SportsCenter @Giannis_An34 Lol Giannis won everything you could win except Dpoy.
MIP, MVP, FMVP, nba champ, DPOY, All Stsr, All Def, All NBA, All Star Game MVP. All he needs is his total stats to go up and he's first ballot lol
@oh_birdwatchers @SportsCenter Still won NBA Finals MVP and the championship
My nba predictions AD will win DPOY KPJ will win MIP And Stephen Curry will win MVP Lakers and nets go against each other which will be a 7 game series and Nets will win

@SquadPodSports @TheNBACentral @Eurohoopsnet Everyone who's ever won NBA MVP is either already in the Hall of Fame or still playing. He's 7x all-NBA and 3x scoring champ on top of the MVP, so he could walk away right now and be a 1st ballot HoFer

@mchoesman @Adizzle236 @JakeAndHoops @TheHoopCentral Mitchell should have been at least second in mvp voting before he went down last year. Arguable if you think he should have won it over jokic tho
Disrespectful Curry is the best player in the NBA better shooter than KD and he’s not too shabby on defense practically the reason why the Warriors was a juggernaut the first unanimous MVP stop the slander cuz ya fav player always get cooked when it’s him … carry the hell on! <U+0001F602> https://t.co/Ibx3kNvolQ

@elbin__bin StephenCurry is wayyyy better then luka. Luka can't even make it pass the first round in playoffs. Steph almost had his 3rd mvp this year, he already got 3 rings and the first person to get 200mill twice in the NBA.  Smh

Wayne Selden BABC’13 via Roxbury/Kansas .NBA vet. Last yr led Ironi Ness Ziona (Israel Premier League) to FIBA Europe Cup Title. Was MVP
@andreblu20 Once Luka advances past the the 1st round, gets to the WCF or wins and MVP…we can talk. As of now…I’ve never seen an NBA MVP (in the first year of his prime) not be considered a top 3 player. It’s wild.
He's been saying this every year:

"Don't call me the MVP until i'm a 2 time MVP"
"Don't call me the 2 time MVP until i'm an NBA champion"

and i respect that. https://t.co/bggGcYXOi8
@austinragle That’s the thing. I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful. More like man an MVP in 12 really isn’t a solidified top 10 player in the NBA today because the top of the league has never been this deep

@deadpansocials @JDaDONda1 @defodeleting @JimothyBuckets @frandom2021 @SquadPodSports @TheNBACentral @Eurohoopsnet How isnt harden a first ballot hall of famer being all nba first team 6 times, MVP, mvp runner up 3 times, led league in scoring 3 times, 6th man, led league in assists .the players actually voted harden for mvp twice in 2015 and 2018 and didnt win in 2017 cuz russ triple double
@bymichaeljulius @DuncanSmithNBA But hey Luka might be the next face of the nba so some folks and the media just wanna push the narrative cause he is a likable guy,there is no denying his absolute talent.

Last year he was by far i mean by far favorite to win the mvp,what did he do?

How is He ranked over Jok?
@TheHoopCentral @Dame_Lillard will win mvp and @trailblazers will win NBA <U+0001F3C6>
@tylernuggets25 Look, as an european guy losing a lot of nights watching NBA i am really cheering for them both but i can't agree Jokic is a better player not even right now. Nikola's MVP was legit, and i'm sure a lot of guys in the media were trying to downplay his game
God I love Giannis more and more each day. 

The humility he shows is breathtaking coming from a man with 2 MVP's, a NBA Ring, and a DPOTY award. https://t.co/q84ZRAVrsx
Sooooo you’re really going to sit here in my face and tell me the REIGNING MVP isn’t in the Top 5 players in the NBA???? Fuck out my face <U+0001F644>

I’m tired of the Jokic disrespect https://t.co/I99wxlKZ2I
Jalen Suggs will be an NBA regular season MVP in 4 years https://t.co/WoaHawyZfA
@SportsCenter GIANNIS IN THE LAST 2 YEARS HAS WON A NBA TITLE WITHOUT A SUPERTEAM!!! HE’S WON 2MVPS, A FINALS MVP WITH A 50 PIECE, DPOY!! KEVIN DURANT HAS PLAYED 45 GAMES TOTAL!!! WHAT’S THE LOGIC OF HIM BEING THE BEST PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE WHEN HE ONLY IMPACTS 1 END OF THE FLOOR? <U+0001F92C>

@stephenasmith Who is the reigning NBA champion and finals MVP @Giannis_An34 has the crown until he gets knocked off
Is it a hot take to say Luka Doncic is becoming overrated? Cuz holy shit number 4 above Steph is crazy, and last year the NBA was trying so hard to give the MVP to Luka in the beginning of the year.
Artis Gilmore led the ABA in rebounding 4 times and shooting twice, and won the Rookie of the Year, MVP, and Finals MVP with Kentucky. He later led the NBA in shooting 4 times, and he is at 37 in my countdown of the #top100 #nba players of all time. https://t.co/qqlvm3xuoN
Kicking off the top 40 in my countdown of the #top100 #nba players of all time with John Havlicek, who won 8 titles with @celtics, including a Finals MVP in 1974, and he would have won it in 1968 if it had existed. He is also Boston's all time top scorer.https://t.co/LK6SLaOeyr

@stephenasmith Stop it Giannis is number 1 he plays both sides of the court Durant doesn’t even have a higher scoring average then Giannis and Giannis beats him in every other category! Plus Giannis beat him with a shot in his face on his court in a game 7 and win the title &amp; finals MVP! #NBA
What  if I told you @Giannis_An34 will shoot 33% from 3 next season?

Would some of y’all finally admit that the man is at least better than average? 

I mean what more does a 2x MVP and NBA Champion have to do?

Feel free to answer… or not.

@TopTierCrown I’m just saying, 2 out of the past 3 years, he was the 2x MVP, the DPOY, the all star game mvp, first team all nba defense, multiple seasons, scores more than kd, more efficient  and the nba champion and a finals mvp- it’s time to give him his due.
@MDTakes Oh I know but usually that’s an indicator if your close since the same people voting for all nba and mvp are the same.
@gochoof @KGsGOAT He was very close but Curry still was a bit more efficient (0.7% difference). But Jokic is the best player overall in the NBA right now, my favorite to be a back-to-back MVP in 2022
@russell_peniche @RichStapless @Serge03x @Lbjnation6 @TheNBACentral @Eurohoopsnet James Harden literally took out an ad in the in the local Milwaukee paper on why he should be mvp before all this lol but yeah Giannis started it https://t.co/Ij7EQP7ENE
@Oscar__NBA That Luka agenda. They trynna make sure he is the MVP lmao
@ESPNNBA @mrvincecarter15 Olympics? Isn’t US undisputed Olympics Champion in basketball? Winning Olympics won’t add anything to US basketball players, not winning it is a crime tho. Why Giannis isn’t the best player in NBA, even after beating KD? Back to back MVP, DPOY, FMVP. What else Giannis should do??
Nikola Jokic isn't about all the attention he's getting from being the reigning MVP, and would rather focus on winning.

Will leading Nuggets Nation to an NBA title change his mind? <U+0001F440> https://t.co/9OuTADg1mh
@JuniBJonesCap Curry is a 3 time NBA champion and the first unanimous MVP in league history also the greatest shooter of all time… come on man don’t be a casual
The disrespect on Derrick Rose’s MVP is wild. He won 62 games without an all star or all nba teammate that year.
@TheBigD05 NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo has agreed to practice with SJBAGB this wednesday to learn from @TheBigD05 sources tell me and Adrien Boitrodwisky
Honestly it's fine, because much more important than a media outlet saying who's top is the actual award that they vote in to proclaim who is the best. I'll take the NBA MVP award over a preseason article. So Congrats to Jokic. https://t.co/OZkZVvWfnJ
When asking who's the best NBA player going into the season or who's top 15, there are just way too many people saying Tatum and Kyrie. MVP? Top 5? These people have lost their perspective.
He’s too humble. 2 time MVP, DPOY and NBA Champ. Talk yo shit Giannis! https://t.co/9hAUYKGPfV
Let us all just soak in the fact that the most recent NBA Finals MVP named a 22-year old Slovenian kid as a better player than him. 

Ahhhhh it’s good to be an #MFFL ! https://t.co/Ev7TqBwQkO
I get ESPN and the NBA looking for the next great white hope but jokic legit just won MVP and went on a playoff run and they still dick eat Luka lmao
@ElGee35 @codyhoudek Now the only thing that matters is whether or not you included the reigning NBA MVP since he’s only one of 35 players to win the award
NBA TikTok is hilarious bro they saying MVP D Rose would be better than Steph Curry <U+0001F62D>
@lil_sh0n @Giannis34SZN Yes tf he was were you even watching the nba before his injury? He was playing better than he did in 2020 and was on path to win MVP <U+0001F480>
@_KnicksAreTrash @LakeShowHoopsPH @rsnellings25 2014 NBA FINALS

“The Spurs' Kawhi Leonard was named the Finals MVP after leading the team in scoring in each of the final three games, averaging 23.7 points and shooting 68.5 percent, after scoring just nine in each of the first two games.”

So much for a role player in 2014
@FirstTake @KendrickPerkins The Luka Doncic Hype Train is out of control!!! How in the HELL is Luka #4? Was he a finalist in the MVP race? NO! Has he won a series in the NBA Playoffs? NO! Jokic won MVP, but gets ranked below Luka? Curry's ranked below too? Nah
Rare to find something Michael Jordan has accomplished. I believe Jordan and Hakeem are the only ones to have won multiple Finals MVPs, an MVP, and a DPOY. #NBA #NBATwitter https://t.co/SXkvaClOsY
@alsouqi_omar Doncic being better than a 3x NBA champion, 2x MVP and finished 3rd in the MVP race last year? No fucking way
NBA Prediction: Luka shocks everyone , wins MVP in route to a conference finals matchup w/ the Lakers.

Don’t think NBA discourse is ever season specific. What KD/Lebron have to do to be MVP worthy is much weaker than what others have to do. https://t.co/eCjOgXEPN6
@troychewning Didn’t know this lol but it only strengthens our argument! In the NFL and NBA, the MVP is and should always be from a winning team. Baseball is different
Jokic is better than luka .. how come the reigning nba MVP is not a top 5 player what the fuck https://t.co/m4K7dDPgrb

Pippen almost won league MVP on the bulls. But you dont like facts. You just argue bs narratives
@hoodies4melo @KorverAintMe @DepressedNets Harden has been traded twice already. Start there.  Luka will **N E V E R** leave Dallas. @mcuban would trade his wife first. It's levels to value.

Has been on the all nba team 1 more time than harden
3 more all defense
4 more all star teams
Im taking wade bc hes elite on both sides of the ball tho. Not accolades
@landonAwhite @indyareaishome @8pts9secs never had a losing season made nba finals, wo  an MVP.

@KLitterdragt That is Giannis Antetokounmpo, He plays for an NBA team named the Milwaukee Bucks. The past 3 seasons he has taken the league by storm and has had 2 MVP's 1 DPOY 1 Finals MVP and 1 Championship. He was only the 3rd player who has won MVP &amp; DPOY in the same season

Feel like Sky are underselling Steph Curry with their caption of "Golden State Warriors NBA Player". Could've at least gone with 3x NBA Champion or 2x NBA MVP.
@plantss10 @resisterqueen @JabarTuzo @TheHoopCentral The skills argument is killing basketball discourse man. Giannis is a 2x MVP-DPOY-4x All-NBA- 5x All-Star-MIP-champ-FMVP at 26 years old. The guy has a solid case for best in the NBA. Is 2019-20 season was comparable to wilts 50/25 season. But he’s not “skilled” enough lol…sad

You keep trying to downgrade the accolades as if they don’t matter when it comes to how players are paid. Only reason why it’s failed, is because Ben wants out now.

@JMurrayWrld @jordandan53 NBA Media is extra horny for Luka. They tried to crown him MVP before the season began last year and oops turns out the Mavs weren't any good lol

Instead of reassessing the landscape, they have all doubled down and Luka is being crowned again before a game is played

AMG, wearing #13, is one of the few female referees in the NBA. Ashley played college ball in Millersville, PA and refereed in the G-League &amp; WNBA before being promoted in 2018 to a full-time NBA position.

Favorite sports stat of all time is that the only teams to win an NBA championship without a past/present/future NBA MVP are the 1989, 1990, and 2004 Detroit Pistons
i saw someone’s definition of a superteam is: perennial MVP threat, perennial All NBA, perennial all-star.. i think thats fair

The year is 2026.  Giannis won his 4th MVP and 3rd title, however NBA Twitter has ranked 11th behind Kyrie who has played in 166 games since 2021, because he can't dribble 30 times really fast and hit a contested long 2.
I'm sorry but if someone posted a 3 year stretch of

2 time mvp
3 time first team all defense
Multiple all defensive teams
Defensive player of the year 
NBA champ and finals mvp
Also the 2nd ever player to score 50 in a closeout finals game 

We'd call them the best in the world https://t.co/LR4nr5Cb2R

@NBAReactz @McDTwin1 @thatsjusttrey @frostybias Based on impact and overall play as a player he has more pts+reb+ast per game than Jordan lebron and Kobe. In 13 years he got 5 mvp and 11 champ and also has the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 8th 10th 12th 13th 16th 18th 31st greatest defensive season in his 13 seasons in nba
@ESPNNBA I’d also help the Lakers win the 1984 nba finals and magic or Kareem would be finals MVP.
@ESPNNBA Another one i’d change is 2008 Lakers Celtics I’d force a game 7 in LA and the Lakers win game 7 Kobe wins 3 finals mvp awards, another one would be game 7 of the 1988 nba finals, I’d help Detroit beat LA Adrian dantley wins finals MVP.
@ESPNNBA Game 7 2013 nba finals have give the Spurs the ball pass it to Timmy Duncan and have him &amp; Tony Parker combine for points and Timmy Duncan wins finals MVP, another one is game 7 2005 nba finals pistons down in the fourth quarter I’d help them win that title and Benny Wallace

Who do you think is winning the NBA MVP in 2022
You have to be obsessed with the work. 
You have to be obsessed with winning. 
You have to seek culture changers more than talent.

@pamelabrayton @SeanShilinsky Baseball isn't really a team sport. Othani is the MVP hands down. Vlad isn't a better player just because his team is winning. This isn't the NBA where's there's a direct correlation between winning and the MVP
@D_Portillo_0 One time Giannis dunked on Simmons and called him a baby and  since then has been 1st team all NBA 3 times MVP twice DPOY once and just steamrolled his way to a title and Ben Simmons has not improved his offensive game at all in that span.
My dark horse NBA MVP is Zach he got something to prove this season

@CMilli11 He’s definitely ranked too low, but using Bron to get that point across gunna have ppl looking at you sideways. Cause before the injuries they had Bron in MVP talks. Kyrie is definitely better than Book. That’s where y’all should’ve started.. don’t go for arguably #1 in the nba

@GuruLakers Famous for “7 Seconds or Less Offense” that Steve Nash 2 MVP Awards. Moving SF Shawn Marion to the 4-spot responsible for what we call the Stretch-4 position revolutionized the NBA. 4 offensive players outside the 3-point line.

2012 - Game 1 - Chicago Bulls

This negative event single-handedly altered the future of an exciting NBA MVP, the Chicago Bulls, and the NBA. https://t.co/5Gi8YYect7
If MLB MVP worked like NBA MVP then Austin Riley would be MVP because Harper,Soto and Tatis’ team wouldn’t make the playoffs. Since it doesn’t work like that Juan Soto should definitely be MVP. They are most likely going to give it to Harper but it should be Soto
@RealOinku @biblicalbook1 Well 5 years ago he won a championship, hit the biggest shot in nba history and out played the unanimous MVP. Next 3 years he got hurt. Last year he was killing in the playoffs to before giannas wanted to injure him. You are the meatmuncher. You don’t know what ya talking about.
@nomoreangelz He was the MVP favorite before he got injured and he’s the best Center in the NBA. You could make a case for Jokic but I’d say Embiid is just as impactful offensively and way better defensively. I don’t see how he’s too high as he stays relatively healthy
Before the NBA season starts…
If AD plays at an MVP level, It’s over for the rest of the league if that Lakers squad stays healthy

NBA Twitter: “wow, how are no superstar congratulate Jokic on his MVP?”

Nikola Jokic: https://t.co/t35WwPxl8g
@jackfrank_jjf How is it not already mainstream when he won the MVP? He can’t play the quirky outsider card anymore. Jokic is very much part of the NBA star establishment.
@CentristMadness @Gunnerjawn I don't even think you need to talk intangibles here. Kyrie has the cushiest job in the NBA--third option behind two MVP candidates. 

Beal has been carrying an inept offense--mostly alone--for like 3 years now and getting better/more efficient every year. No-brainer to me.
@Magik_NBA From MVP to 6th. ESPN is smoking something.
@overtime @ACFresh21 is this the 2021/2022 Nba MVP?
@33PhillyKicks @BillyReinhardt Harden is statistically better at almost everything Lillard hasn’t sniffed an MVP or a 1st team All NBA selection
@PAlNPACKER_ mvp cant be underrated lol and he has a top 5 biggest fanbase in the nba
KD - Best player in the NBA. 2022 MVP.
BRON - top 5 player in the league at 36 and my GOAT.
RJ - underrated by the league but overrated by Knicks fans. Very good role player if he’s on a contender.
BEAL - properly rated. 2022 runner up in PPG (Trae Young is #1)

(Part 2)

@tylercornell03 @junito78p @MissngLnk @TheNBACentral Aight bro. If Tatum has 2 MVPs, DPOY, Finals MVP, 5X First Team NBA, 4X All Defensive Team by the age of 26, I’ll start believing you. Right now Giannis got as many MVPs as Jason Tatum has All Star game appearances <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>
@DonnySinsxx @crystal_nexus @DatShitKra_Mer @ESPNNBA @KyrieIrving @KingJames LeBron James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds and 8.9 assists in 7 games in the 2016 NBA FINALS. Kyrie Irving averaged 27.1 points, 3.9 rebounds and 3.9 assists in 7 games in the 2016 NBA FINALS. No denying he hit a big shot but that's where it ends. MVP was awarded correctly
@AshNicoleMoss i’m surprised by this take but @AshNicoleMoss knows a lot in regards to hoops. i’ll politely disagree because i would personally put jokic,the reigning mvp, above a young luka who has had an incredible start to his nba career. i even think luka would agree he’s not there yet

@shwinnypooh If only he could play more like 2x MVP, Finals MVP, DPOY, and NBA champ Giannis Antetokounpo.
Wait James Harden is 10 on that list? That’s abysmal - way too low for him. He was in my eyes the NBA MVP before his hamstring injury last season.
@fastbreakbreak @eefiala What MVP? I watch ESPN all the time and didn't think the NBA had an MVP last year.
@HiveCards He won MVP for that. If the NBA did a draft today of every human on the planet, Id guess not one would take Jokic before Luka.
Is Nikola Jokic a Top 5 player in the NBA? https://t.co/g2HXqL8lIg
Crazy how people say KD the best player and scorer in basketball. 7 feet never avg 10 rebounds in his nba career never avg 2 blks.  Haven't won mvp in about 8 years haven't won a scoring title in  about 8 years. He dont make his team mates better . @espn @ShannonSharpe
@frostybias One of these players “couldn’t keep up in in today’s NBA.” The other is the MVP. https://t.co/MVrCQt9p66
Why the reigning NBA MVP failed to crack the top five of NBArank https://t.co/p3QenXCuTm
@AylingGregor @TheHoopCentral Exactly, if they exceed expectations and Tatum puts up numbers like that. He will definitely be an MVP candidate.
Nikola Jokic is the reigning NBA MVP, but there are four players ahead of him on the #SITop100

@RobinLundberg and @AshNicoleMoss debate whether Jokic should be ranked higher or lower than No. 5 <U+0001F914> https://t.co/Zjm4woz72T
ur in his dms, I’m in his mvp acceptance speech. He is the best player in the NBA and he thinks I’m “da real MVP.” I am Kevin Durant’s mother
@rudysaintclaire Why would the wolves trade an MVP caliber player, Malik and prince and get the worst contract in the NBA a mediocre C and only 2 shitty picks? 

Wolves fly out to each city and laugh in the face of the GM and contribute to block their number horrible trade
Fox is peaking at an all nba level maybe even weak mvp tbh https://t.co/MllRxknVoj

@JamesEdrick3 @TheNBACentral In the last 3 years Giannis has 2 League MVPs and a defensive player of the year award. This past season he led his team to an NBA championship, winning finals.mvp with one of the greatest finals performances ever. How is he not number one?
@the_picketfence @pperez_4 @TheNBACentral Giannis scores just as often as KD but more efficiently. Giannis is a better rebounder and passer than KD. Giannis is arguably the best defensive player in the NBA. In the last 3 years Giannis has 2 League MVPs, a Defensive POY, an NBA championship and a finals.mvp.
4 MVP’s and 4 NBA titles vs. 0 MVP’s and 1 NBA title https://t.co/igS6zBD3LO
@_YoCliff @PearlBoykins Bran , if Bron was coming off 2 MVP’s a DPOY a chip , a finals MVP 3 1st team all NBA’s and 3 1st team All defense in 3 years you would literally have an orgasm.
@_JasonLT He has 2 MVP’s , a DPOY , 3 first team all NBA’s , 3 first team all defense , a ring and a FMVP all in the last 3 years. He’s the best by like every metric right now. What more would you like to see ? More tween hesi’s ? I’m genuinely curious lol

@YoungNBA I agree Shane. There's a small chance that he'll be the MVP. However, I believe when he's healthy, he's still a top tier player in the #NBA.
@dustyhombre @ESPNNBA Lmfaoooo okay buddy, the only thing slowing down Embiid in the modern NBA is his health. Prior to his injury last year he was wrecking the league and the front runner for MVP but yeah ur right
Episode 1 can be him going to golden state and they finally get a three peat. Curry gets his first finals mvp trophy. Simmons also gets a finals mvp. Curry becomes a 6x nba champ. The warriors arena moves once again but this time on their own island!!! next to Alcatraz!!!
TIL NBA MVP Nikola Jokic is a horse girl lol
For context, it appears Karl-Anthony Towns is reacting to the 2021 ESPN Top 100 NBA rankings leaving out the reigning league MVP in the top 5. https://t.co/xJJObzVaQh

@shwinnypooh @LaltenNBA @StacyPatton89 No, see, in that specific time frame, Giannis started to become a dominant MVP, Luka Doncic entered the NBA, and better players than KAT showed they are a better building block.

Nobody has claimed KAT to be the best damn player in the league. He’s just better than Julius Randle,
@SInow KD, the best player, on earth and             it was Giannis, that won the NBA Championship and Final MVP.  I 
will give Giannis, his earned 
respect of what he accomplished,
last season. Giannis is ahead, of 
KD, last season. Opinion
@DontGetSunburnt @ClipsLand @Baniya_tera_bap @spencergh2 So Devin Booker, the person who didn’t make all nba, lead his team over the mvp candidate? Mind you book never made the playoffs, but cp3 comes there and his first year makes them
@LeoScarselletta @FoolishBB This comment reeks of the NBA MVP process…the NBA MVP gets passed around like a participation trophy. So, if Ohtani kept putting up historic seasons it still shouldn’t go to him?
How is @KyrieIrving ranked 20th in the nba behind ppl like d book and Trae young. Granted they nice, but Kyrie averaged 27ppg and had a 50/40/90 szn. MVP szn
@kylecarbone56 @HoodieSlim7 @Giannis34SZN @TheNBACentral wow random article, surely Giannis Didn’t say Lebron was the best player in the world after this; o wait he did https://t.co/Ujwgr72Fjz

@knowerofbaII @johnrivers131 it’s usually jus the qb w the best year on a playoff team, they get it right most of the time. the nba is way more ab storylines. rodgers has had trash games in 2 of his mvp seasons. n still won, the beginning of the season doesn’t matter at all.
@knowerofbaII @johnrivers131 narratives don’t dominate the nfl mvp the way they do the nba

@waxx_attack I really like Luka Doncic as a basketball player. Truly I do. But to say he’s better than the MVP of the NBA before he’s even won a playoff series is absurd to me and people keep saying it

@PHNX_Wildcats Iguodala has Finals MVP, All-NBA Def 1st/2nd, NBA All-Star, 3x Champion, and was nearly a 20 ppg scorer (19.9) at peak.

According to multiple metrics you can argue off well-rounded career that he is a top-75 NBA All-Time. Im not saying this, but multiple metrics say it.
If @ZachLaVine perfects his footwork, he is going to do All NBA damage. I always said that MJ, McHale, and Hakeem had HOF footwork. It was obvious they put a ton of effort and training into perfecting their jabs, fakes, and first step. Don’t sleep on LaVine as an MVP candidate! https://t.co/LlaOXf6iM4

@ChaddeusY @waitina7 @22waywiggins @IAmKingJC @NBAPaint1 Who is plenty of people. Waitina7 is right, Steph is overrated compared to the LeBron, KD, Kawhi’s of the world. He’s NOT on that level. Does he have a NBA Finals MVP? Exactly! Iggy does though.  Ya’ll gotta know your history and context. No KD and Steph has ONE ring!
@ESPNNBA That 2021 style foul called against Scottie Pippen when trying to defend Hubert Davis 3-pointer in 1994 playoff series.

One of the most garbage calls in NBA history IMO. Ruined that post-Jordan retirement MVP run for Pippen.

@AshNicoleMoss If Kyrie is so good why can’t he lead a team to success? Explain Cavs before lebron? Celtics success without him VS with him. CP3 is better right now and always has been. AI was MVP and lead NBA is scoring. Kyrie could never
Corey Sanders supposed to be a 2x NBA MVP by now smh https://t.co/feX6AcODqG
9. Joel Embiid
Joel Embiid was on track to win the MVP before his injury. But, that is the problem with Embiid, he can't play more than 70 games in a full season. Embiid, like AD, is one of the best Defenders and one of the most versatile scorers as a center in NBA history. https://t.co/xRG4DquFGE
7. Nikola Jokic
MVP Nikola Jokic is set to have another incredible season. Jokic is the best offensive Center in NBA History and is one of the best playmakers as well. Jokic hasn't seen much playoff success and isn't the greatest defender. But he's still an incredible player. https://t.co/OsYvyaYrej
Sir are you suggesting that Jimmy Butler is the best player in the NBA?

Also the reigning finals MVP swept Jimmy Butler’s team in the first round on his way to a championship https://t.co/N4JjVMD09a
Russ is right. Here are some facts…
1. He was the 2nd best player on a finals team
2. Multiple time all nba
3. He’s won multiple playoff series
4. Was an MVP
5. Other players like playing with him
6. He was the PG for MVP KD https://t.co/xP0nBtddoW

@PranavSriraman @Oscar__NBA @PatrickMahomes Honestly they should make a separate award for qbs and call it like the Otto graham award or sum and make the “mvp” most outstanding player
@Oscar__NBA @PatrickMahomes I don’t hate this take because I think Henry is so clear of every other back but MVP is basically a QB award atp sadly.

@dougherty_jesse Yeah MVP for MLB is different from the NFL or NBA. You play offense one player at a time, there is only so much you can do to imoact the outcome if the game unlike an amazing QB or Dominant NBA player

@Bignole936 To dona fair comparison, you need to compare Zions numbers to Julius Randles stats from his 3rd or 4th year or whatever year it was for Zion lol. There is no comparison. By the time Zion is Julius Randles age he'll probably have some all NBA's and maybe an MVP under his belt lol
@LeBatardShow @Stugotz790 In 20 years this is how I will be reflecting on the NBA abolished hand check rule of 2004 enabling players like Giannis, Lebron, Westbrook to win MVP’s barreling into the lane while being unable to do what the game was created for, shooting a ball

Ben Simmons is an all nba/ mvp caliber talent 

You’re not getting anything close to Simmons for Wall

Ben can shoot and move without the ball and there’s plenty of workout film to prove it

He can shoot just fine and has moves at every level, he just needs to be put in a situation where his shooting isn’t needed

@whomartyp @TheTyJager Lol 2x MVP, 5 rings, 3x finals MVP, NBA All Star MVP, Naismith Player of the Year in college. The list goes on. If you rank Jordan over LeBron due to rings there’s no reason to not do the same here. The Big Fundamental is the best PF to ever play the game point blank period.
You never know what type of person is gonna end up NBA MVP. https://t.co/95W2tm83ZG
@GuruLakers The NBA media had been ready to crown run and gun since they robbed Kobe of MVP in 05 and 06. They were tired of watching their favorite players getting dunked on and the great white hope Steve Nash was everything they ever wanted.
@RxckzMxxn @19Danieldad @HashMCd @scartonradio @jaycapskiii___ @Anthonysmdoyle @JJMaples55_MST Kind of ridiculous to say Embiid just plays his position well. He's an MVP and defensive player of the year candidate and probably the best Center in the NBA. Simmons does alot on the defensive end nobody doubts that but his half court offense hurts the team as well.
@RxckzMxxn @19Danieldad @HashMCd @scartonradio @jaycapskiii___ @Anthonysmdoyle @JJMaples55_MST Fuck no they aren't neck and neck. Embiid much better offensively, same level on defense, all star starter, all NBA first team, and MVP candidate. Of course he has flaws too like always being out of shape but overall much better player than Ben.
Vaugh Miller being minsiter of environment is like me being MVP of the NBA.
@RyanGarciaESM mike trout was a perennial MVP on below .500 teams and no one questioned it but now all of it sudden it matters? this isn’t the NBA, best case scenario your best hitter only get 1/9th of your team’s total plate appearances. i thought we moved past this line of thinking.

@zoyalikesmilfs How can the nba mvp award winner for the past 9 years look bad
@Lure132 @MLBStats @MLB I'm not arguing that he isn't the best, just that with him, the Angels still aren't any better than .500. Where as the Jays would be  .500 without Vald. Lebanon is the best in nba, but doesn't win MVP as an example. Which player has the biggest impact to their team? Vald.
@NBABlackburn Lol the NBA is fuming they had to give this guy the MVP award <U+0001F602>
@yaw17953130 @bhallier @AlexiLalas It means other countries are capable of being the very best without max attention, same with Serbia &amp; regular season NBA MVP Nikola Jokic.

Nikola Jokic is easily the least hyped up and least talked about MVP in modern NBA history. I wonder why?

@bethanybalcer Typically with end of season awards, leagues don't give money for winning them. However, sponsors often give prizes or money, like Kia giving a car for NBA MVP. Also, contract often include language to address comp related to indv. performance milestones.
@CNBC Do we get articles when the NBA awards are swept by black people?? When is last time NBA had a white MVP??

@BPage24 @Jetman2525 @Embiid4MVP @MLB @googlecloud 2 of Mike Trout’s 3 MVPs have come in years the Angels didn’t make the playoffs. It’s not a dealbreaker. This isn’t the NBA where half the league makes the playoffs. Plenty of MLB MVP have come from non-playoff teams. https://t.co/Gi4gvdFEkw

*KD only off this list because I feel voters will not show him the love because of Harden &amp; Kyrie- not fair at all. 
@BR_NBA
@_ScottieTheKid @Jetman2525 @Embiid4MVP @MLB @googlecloud Then tell me how Mike Trout doesn’t win every year? You looking at numbers alone? You think Westbrook should be MVP every year in the NBA? Even as a Braves fan I like Bryce and he’s having an insane year, but if they miss the playoffs I don’t see how anyone gets MVP.IMO of course
@dretheoutsider_ @LordMasonx Tell me when a team won 67 games and no one made first team all nba. Tell me when a team won 67 games and no one was top 5 in mvp. That’s all i ask. We punishing everyone after that bullshit

@Jdcostin910 NBA does the best job at marketing it’s players more than it’s teams imo. K tho k it’s also because of how the nba is more of a worldwide brand compared to the NFL which caters to the US and Mexico and London since they play games there.
@NBA_taIks 4 finals MVP’s for LeBron vs 2 Kobe . So only 2/5 times kobe was  the most valuable for the championship. The other 3 (in a row I might add ) were shaq . Bron definitely better
@GTJxRaptors Both average 27 points per game  rebounds and assists, Bron has more regular season and finals MVP’s, Bron leads the entire NBA playoff history in points . Bron also has a higher career in points <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F974>

2. Doesn't matter NBA egos don't change w the coach.

4. Makes sense. We'll see.
5. Nash was an NBA MVP. He knows who runs the league.
@NBA Jokic the most disrespected mvp
@NBA Where is the MVP?
@XelaPhila @toneyboloney @FrancisGDavis @DerekBodnerNBA Anyways what are your thought on the Ben situation? I'm hoping Matisse starts next season just needs to shoot better. His defense on KD in the Olympics was insane. Also would love the space embiid gets now having a shooting/scoring guard. Almost got MVP with Ben so imagine.
@ben_defender @atomicbombast1c @SportsCenter @wojespn And I think if Ben gets traded without maxey we'll be fine. You start Matisse and depending on who you get back also start maxey. Embiid has been MVP caliber with his PG being 6'10 clogging his paint and making it 4v5 in the half court. We haven't seen prime embiid yet<U+0001F440><U+0001F440>
@KamBrothers 

Lakers win the 2021-2022 NBA Championship — which is most likely:

1. AD wins DPOY;
2. Bron has a dominating regular season and wins league MVP;
3. Vogel wins Coach of the Year;
4. Pelinka wins Executive of the Year;
5. Nothing. Lakers get snubbed by league voting.
I’m writing a sci-fi novel. It’s about a self-centered NBA player that can’t shoot, but thinks he’s an MVP. He refuses to honor his contract and sits out.  One day he gets abducted by aliens who perform experiments. They return him to earth where he still sucks.  I need a title.
@Sixers_Matt Must have been difficult being "unnecessarily patient" w/ a 25 year old player who is a 3 time all star, has a 3rd team all nba, 2 straight all D teams, was runner up in DPOY and got mvp votes this year, top 20 in D win shares 4 straight seasons, top 20 in fg % 4 times etc etc <U+0001F602>
@jobachamberlin1 @LakerCentral365 Who’s being naive now <U+0001F923>. NBA absolutely does step in to preserve its product. A sixers team with an mvp candidate in Embiid is a financial jackpot and they will mediate. Do some research.  Rockets got some great rebuilding pieces for a guy that limped thorough the second round.
@FanMahome Harden in 2017 had one of the biggest Star collapse in nba history. After underperforming every playoffs, In do or die game 6 of 2017 WC semifinals, he took 11 shots total(2 inside 3 pt) for 10 points &amp; 6 TOs. That year he was 2nd in mvp vote. Did Rockets toss him under the bus?
@Okrob_ @KimoLbj @Ballislife How many scoring titles, mvp titles, finals mvp titles, all defensive NBA and so on does your 5th greatest player of all time have? Lebron is great but he's not even above Kobe. Lebron isn't even top 4. Come on, kid.

@nba_philly @DerekBodnerNBA It’s the truth. The guy has never played 65* games in a season. The same lunatics that think he deserved MVP last year are the ones that think Anthony Edwards for Ben Simmons is a fair trade. Sixers are paying for intentionally losing all those years

@WeezyOD @EdwinaPinero @StacyPatton89 I dont see his ppg staying but I see his efficiency rising a good chunk and his assists as well with the extra spacing. Rebounds might diminish as well due to mitch being healthy. Mvp probably not gonna be in his cards, but all NBA easily
For years, the NBA MVP was a market for favorites only. Then Nikola Jokic cashed at 36-1, which raises the question: Can a true long shot win, after all?

@JustEsBaraheni @Travis_Sawchik @theScore In the NBA, the unofficial rule was that your team had to win at least 50 games. That's how Steve Nash on the Suns beat out Kobe and Shaq those years. 

But then Westbrook was named MVP, although OKC won &lt;50 games. Otani can be considered the MLB equivalent of the trip-dub king.

Based on Kings twitter, if Mitchell isn't the NBA finals MVP then I will be disappointed.
@BlackedOut__ I remember Russ got that tripledouble mvp as the 6th seed .After that idk fr but you know the NBA like to push narratives like if ben Simmons was to come out next year play his sme game but got a 12-15 footer shooting abt 41fG &amp; 70FT and HOU make the play-in .he might steal a mvp

@Str8Buckets_ @MinusAllFilters @wojespn bottom line is he had 4 years to get a jumpshot and with the best help in the nba he failed to do so. which wasted a mvp year from joel
@CobyValentine Reminds of Kobe having a better season and the nba giving Nash his second mvp instead. Hopefully vladdy get it this year. That boy is a beast.

@HanaHoops Trae Young 2021 NBA mvp
@FullTimeHoops1 Baron Davis and a young Derrick Rose were also explosive NBA players who could dunk over taller dudes. Davis, who played for UCLA in college, had a very solid NBA career. Rose, who played in college at Memphis, was named NBA MVP at age 22. Injuries have hampered his pro career.
It’s interesting that the NBA’s Red Auerbach Coach of the Year trophy &amp; Bill Russell Finals MVP trophy honor a Celtic duo that were synonymous with winning. Russell won 11 NBA titles in 13 years, including 2 as player-coach. Both men had a huge impact on the NBA’s early success.
@SteveCelts @WitMiBBall @dphilton @AndrewDBailey @JaMorant So you’re a casual if you think that a singular dunk is worth an MVP nod. I get it. You’re new to this. 

I appreciate Ja Morant, don’t get it twisted. But he’s not remotely close to the top dogs in the NBA.

@Stephen0610 @NBA I think they should add a playoff MVP (different from finals MVP) too. I'm sure there'd be seasons it's the same player but I think it'd go a long way towards recognizing who actually is the best player in the league in a given season
@darvon4554 @MagicJohnson @KingJames The most points per game in NBA history. Only player to win MVP, Defensive player of the year in the same year. Most points per game in NBA finals
@jay_pea619 @___Colb___ @TROTWAM It’s the nba voters, it’s the way they cover him that won’t even make him win the mvp, the voters are so obsessed over Giannis, Jokic, Joel, KD, Luka, N Steph they are obsessed wit who those players should win it
Two awards I would like to see the @NBA add to the regular season awards are the following.

•Offensive player of the year
•Biggest comeback player of the year

I think those would be great while balancing how we look at other awards like most improved and MVP.
Don’t matter what team you trade Ben Simmons to because the day he decides to be the player you see in those pick up games in 82 games HE TRANSFORMING ANY FRANCHISE! You crazy if you don’t know that, that team instantly got a MVP candidate! @NBA @sixers @BenSimmons25 @KingJames
Just for context Bill Russell won 5 league MVP's and 11 NBA championships https://t.co/ZkBOlT4iDb

With the 2021-22 NBA season creeping up on us next month, it’s time to rank the top MVP candidates. There are more than a few qualified candidates and the battle for the award should come down to the wire as it did last season. https://t.co/zHAxO6oIUM

Joe Johnson, aka “Iso Joe,” is coming off another phenomenal season in entertainment mogul Ice Cube’s Big 3 league, winning league MVP for the second time. Will somebody give the 7-time All-Star a shot at age 40?

@EuroBasket @tonyparker @FRABasketball 4 NBA titles, 1 MVP finals, top 10 NBA pass player, top 10 NBA playoff games played, 17 years in NBA, 4 medals with France, 15 points in France career. What else?
NBA rankings drop tomorrow. KD or Giannis should be no. 1. Long as he’s healthy, Durant should be in the MVP race all year.
@Jody_McFly Yeah I want the same. I want Ben to be in mvp talks so these teams can keep being forced to learn hard lessons. They gotta stop mistreating players. There are 500 nba caliber players in the world at any given time. Respect them or we will start seeing less.
Ay yo @Flight23White stop being a simp for curry. Every video you act like a curry fan girl. I hope you know his parents are divorced and curry is not the best point guard in the league. It has to be Derrick rose. Was curry the youngest mvp in nba history? No so stop it flight.
Westbrook will have Lebron and Ad in mvp conversation #nba #lebron #Lakers #ad #Westbrook
@MylesTW So awards should be based on color, not performance? Good to know.  Will be waiting for the next white NBA MVP, then Latino, then Asian, don't leave out Native Americans, or people from India, and of course a Gay Man.  Sounds ridiculous, but that's what race baiters do.

@KhepryRe @SportsCenter @ESPNNBA And is still a 7x all star, an all star MVP, a Rookie of The Year, an olympic gold medalist, and a World Cup champion, a World Cup MVP, and an NBA Champion. So imagine if he didn’t miss the 200 games

I suppose most MVP’s in NBA cones from goalscorers? Most MVP’s in NFL go to Quarterbacks. The problem is the award is not necessarily the most effective it even the best in AFL. It’s usually the most possessions. Who led possessions?

@Bonvivant1979 @LevitatingWolf @jrichardgoodman Agreed, 100%.  I've always thought the NBA should have a postseason MVP instead of a Finals MVP.  Kobe dominated the Kings and Spurs that year.
After winning another BIG3 MVP, Joe Johnson says he’s keeping the door open for a return to the NBA.

@N_200_zz @chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops Well i disagree, because he was much better in europe as teen and main guy. Luka is next mvp but in europe he got it bcause Real wanted to cash him in nba. He wasnt best in final four or in regular season. He was 3 best in ff and 4/5 best in regular season, Toni was dominant mvp
No, you said old Kareem would close out the '90s Bulls in 6 or 7 games. That just isn't true. 

I watched the late '80s NBA playoffs LIVE. Kareem was still a solid contributor, but not MVP level like 1985.

Divac in 1991 was more productive. Kareem was just too old at that point. https://t.co/zSuRwtG3Ba https://t.co/TGdrAEARiZ
@twitchejnave What?  No those are not the same thing. Lebron James is the best player in the NBA and yet not the MVP for years....
@jimdangle69 @OHB_lawren @JuJu_3xx @ClippersNets Not only is top 15 not an actual candidate but it’s written by some random dude who works for https://t.co/eh2GOBXbpx. It’s 1 opinion who says kyrie isn’t even a top 10 candidate. Is Julius MVP caliber? Rudy?  No and they’re both above Kyrie on both of the lists he showed.
@pharaoh785 @24IamTheGOAT8 I love people saying that the plumbers of the 90s wouldn't keep up with the athletic freaks of the modern NBA. Meanwhile in the modern NBA, the current MVP is literally a slow, unathletic, non-physical white dude.

Kyler Murray gotta be MVP of the league rn, lord have mercy
@Rogue_slate @urkle9 I was talking about First Team All NBA, but Westbrook didn't deserve MVP either.  Harden would have been a better choice.  Westbrook is the worst MVP in history.
@Rogue_slate @urkle9 How the fuck does it work?  Befoe then, when did the MVP ever win just 47 games?  Made FIrst Team All NBA over a dude who led a team to 67 wins?  They literally changed the rules because the league was pissed KD joined the Dubs.  Please tell me you are on drugs or something.
@Rogue_slate @urkle9 When did a dude that didn't win 50 games make First Team All NBA over a worthy candidate that won over 60 games?  You're just talking out of your ass now.  That was the only time.  And Steph was not MVP this year.  He wasn't even in my top 3.

Lamar Jackson is to the NFL what Giannis was to the NBA six months ago. He won an MVP at a young age but he gets trashed on Twitter because he hasn’t won a championship and his play style isn’t conventional.
@J03LJ3 Hardaway made two all star teams with the Heat… and three all NBA teams with the Heat… he also earned MVP votes (he came in 4th) with the Heat… There is no comparison… at all. Go find a new slant.
@MrChuckD @DaveWinfieldHOF Drafted in 3 sports by 4 major league teams (MLB, NFL, NBA, and ABA), was the best hitter, ace pitcher, and CWS MVP on his college team, and never spent a single day in the minor leagues.
@jimdangle69 @ClippersNets @NetsHomeBr @D4DcRIES @rhynopig87 That is where I and most nba players and analysts would disagree. Kyrie for sure has the talent and ability to be a MVP. It more so his window has passed then anything else
@johnnybezgood I love this concept of “lebron dominates nba”. He played 18 seasons so far, won 4 championships (22%) and one scoring title (5%). Also he made even Andre Iguodala a finals mvp, so dominating he is
@YouDontKnowISH_ @plasticono215 @TheNBACentral Shaq is a buffoon &amp; hater.

@NBA @nbatopshot Defensive player of the year, finals mvp. Giannis
@JuJu_3xx @ClippersNets You either need to have a historic offensive year as a clear #1 on a contender, or be an all nba caliber player on both sides of the ball and be the #1 option on a contending team to be a real MVP threat. Look at the dudes who win it man. Kyrie is not on their level.
Was Kobe Bryant's MVP season his best season in the NBA?
NBA Twitter Reacts To Zion Willamson Winning 2024 MVP : https://t.co/G2QBUtoTRx
A more obscure example is Chauncey Billups and Allen Iverson. Billups scored 15 points per game during his career while Iverson averaged 26 points per game during his career. He also won the NBA MVP and made 7 All-NBA teams.  Clearly Iverson was the better individual player. https://t.co/rPgSj4Boll
However, Chauncey Billups won the NBA championship &amp; Finals MVP, in 2004. Iverson never won these accolades. When he and Billups were traded for one another, something interesting happened. Billups led the Denver Nuggets to the Conference Finals, something Iverson failed to do. https://t.co/seAoJWpwYR

@Drazah__ MLB is probably doing the mvp award right. NBA NFL definitely have narratives and team record as a factor
@NoahL_14 @firejudgepls It’s not just about sacks I fully get it but sweat is also top 5 in impact which like they say in the nba if u got 2 mvp candidates they cancel. Young is good but he’s not what I’m hearing.
@KCinCypress62 Matt Ryan is Romo with an MVP and Super Bowl appearance that sounds about right
And lastly?
 Because bookies wreck me today 
I no win !!  

Who is the MVP of the NBA 2021?
First to answer correctly and you must retweet!!!
@Raptors36557179 @bamaddamayo @TheNBACentral no doubt - peak Shaq was already the best player in the NBA for a time (won an MVP in 2000 so that’s one season right there without the rules of today’s game )

Dude was a two-time MVP and a Finals MVP by age 22 in a solid, star-filled era of the NBA.
I travelled all the way to NOLA in 2017 to watch the NBA all star finals I.e to see AD <U+0001F602>. He got MVP and I was so hyped <U+0001F97A>. He was with the Pelicans at the time.

@domsougly MVP and scoring/assists titles man this isn't the NBA
Yooo! NBA Champion and MVP @Giannis_An34 is in my country Cyprus! Yet I have no chance of even seeing him cause I'm on the North Side. Sad.
#MVP #Cyprus
@BobMonr14690301 @urkle9 Here comes the non objective shit. Just Bron hate, Curry Stan. 

Curry isn’t bad. But nothing about 16-17 would make him the mvp or 1st team all nba. He was a “candidate” but the guys who got it, clearly earned it.
@shawndawndada @Jakewantsanap @TheWarriorsTalk Top 15-20 I agree for me an alltime great is a top 10 player alltime one who has reg stats playoff stats playoff appearance  MVP's FMVP's chips allstars all nba all defense ect
@wcruben1 @TheWarriorsTalk I feel Alltime great needs to have chips MVP's FMVP's reg stats playoff stats playoff appearance  all nba all defense allstars ect stats are part of the individual part of his career how great he was thru out his career
@ClutchPointsApp @MagicJohnson @StephenCurry30 @IsiahThomas Magic 13 season.       Curry 12 season 
5 chips                         3 chips
3 MVP's.                      2 MVP's 
3 FMVP's.                    0 FMVP's 
12 allstar.                      7 allstar            
10 all nba.                     7 all nba

Magic best pg alltime
@DaddySports @mrtomeoni Robert Covington is the most underrated player in the NBA. He is the perfect modern NBA player. If you don't agree with me, then your a casual who was impressed by Russel Westbrook's stat padding MVP year. Ya sheep
@BadNBATakes_ @acidmindmelt @legoatkawhifan I don’t care about chips when evaluating players. I care about the actual career value. And I do it so the peak years are worth more so I do value peak a lot. But like I said when u have 4 more mvp level years and 6 more all nba level years, it makes it close even with peak gap
@BadNBATakes_ @legoatkawhifan @acidmindmelt Kareem has like 4 more mvp level seasons and 6 more seasons of at least all nba. You can’t act like that’s nothing

@Jepte02196690 @newlyalex @JavonteVaeza I'll take LeBron James who's won an MVP in the NBA finals and a world championship in 2020 over the low bar your setting for Luka who wasn't even in the top 3 in MVP voting he was 6th. So following your MVP voting logic CP3  is it better than luka who finished 6th <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F> C'mon <U+0001F923>
@chanfeathers @newlyalex @JavonteVaeza When your talking about right now LeBron who was supposed to make it to the NBA finals but got hurt who has 4 NBA championships being less than Luka who can't get his team out of the 1st rd of the playoffs while bypassing Giannis who won the MVP and the NBA Championship <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>
@Jepte02196690 @newlyalex @JavonteVaeza That's correct I'll take LeBron a proven winner right now who won the finals MVP and NBA championship in 20 who was leading his team to another championship in 21 before injury over low bar Luka who was 6th in MVP results &amp; can't get the Mavs out of the 1st rd of the playoffs<U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>
@GuitaristJT @newlyalex @JavonteVaeza So far you've tried equate the Luka low bar first round lost lac to a LeBron NBA Championship win.

Try to equate the Luka low bar finishing 6th in NBA MVP voting to a player who's actually won the MVP and the championship MVP. C'mon <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>

@goatshooter30 @MimiMungu @JJMaples55_MST To be fair Shaq made a career out of manipulating mentally weak bigs.

Insert: AD, Embiid, Jokic ALL MVP caliber.

Which of these TOP 3 BIGS in the NBA would be successful in guarding Shaq in the post?

Secondly, which of these Top Bigs is mentally/physically intimidating Shaq?

@njkid3 @BurnerSpst @urkle9 @dubsforever7 Like you’re acting like the Rockets didn’t have the MVP runner up and another all nba caliber player on their team…. Kind of like the bucks lol
@NicoleMcMilllon @CoachQues Damn you’d think by the way you talk about him that he wouldn’t even be an NBA player. Much less a 4x champion, 4x FMVP, 4x MVP, most All NBA 1st Teams ever, most all nba ever, on the verge of most all star ever, a scoring and assist champ, with countless other records
@Dpress123 @theScore I think a better way of describing this potential farce of an MVP win for Ohtani is that MLB is going the ways of NBA with narrative based voting for the year end awards rather than by actual stats

People hype up Ohtani's pitching but as the stats stand, he wouldn't win Cy Young
@0nlyHoops I REALLY started watching (as I’m not a casual fan) in 2017 when OKC had Russ, PG and Melo.

But Russ’s MVP season was the reason I became an NBA fan.

@twolveswave <U+0001F64B> if you are admitting you assumed "The Most Spectacular Player" award meant MVP but actually had no idea that it didn't. Now you looked it up for the first time and try to side step that part by throwing an example of a player who also didn't reach their NBA expectations. . .
There hasn't been a lot of Celtics news of late, which gave me the perfect opportunity to make my bold prediction: Jayson Tatum will be in the NBA MVP mix this upcoming season. For @ForbesSports

It is amazing that people claim the big man doesnt matter in todays nba. Yet Jokic is MVP, Embiid likely beats out Jokic if he stays healthy. The Hawks turn around was due to Capela playing more mins. AD and Giannis closed games at the 5 for the last 2 champs at 6ft 11.
Maybe i'll get the mvp of The NBA celebrity game

@Lakers
@EATA8_BALL @BrownOfJaylen @ChillDoc5 @champagnexkenny @HoopsSupply AD has never played a full 82 games season but maybe once in his whole career. Jokic has been consistently healthy. Jokic has 3 all nba appearances, 2 first teams &amp; 3 all star selections. All this as a second round pick. AD DONT HAVE A MVP <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F62D>.
@IcePiqqCardiay @BrownOfJaylen @ChillDoc5 @champagnexkenny @HoopsSupply AD has 4 top 5 MVP finishes and 5X 1st Team All NBA
@Hkhutchi Same as every MVP style award in sports, NFL it’s usually always the QB with the best stats, NBA MVP is generally the player with the best stats etc

@LeGoat03824702 @BleacherReport @KingJames @russwest44 averaged a 20ppg+ triple double while leading the league in career high 11asp  and top 6 in the nba  with career high 11 rpg. Leading a  average team to the playoffs while finishing top 10 in MVP voting and winning 1x player of the month. But slightly average ?
Random hot takes for this NBA season:

Jayson Tatum will win MVP

This will be the last year of prime James Harden

Westbrook and Lebron will be the first players to both average triple doubles on the same team.

Suns won’t make the playoffs

Zach Lavine All-NBA first team
@Marquis81525836 @PBS I agree 100%!You nailed it! He won 3 State Championships,3Ncaa Championships,and 6 NBA Championships! Facts! Plus he also has 6 Mvp's!
@NuggetsNationCP As a fan of the Nuggets, I would enjoy another MVP season for Joker. 

As a fan of the Nikola Jokic: I know that he doesn't care about his stats or winning another MVP. He already earned the MVP.
He would rather earn the NBA Championship.

@CBandz25 @CroixBoy @JCrossover @Ballislife Yeah but considering he lead 96 bulls to 72 wins, was the MVP, Was 1st in Win shares, Was 6th in DPOY voting, Won a scoring champion, was 1st team all nba, was first team all defense, Averaged 30.7 in the playoffs, Won the champion and FMVP. I’d say that was the best guard Season
@DimeDropperPod @cedricmaxwell81 Many forget he was 1979 NBA Finals MVP
@OkayButNo5 @FadeawayWorld Go back and look at the mvp ladder around March on https://t.co/IQxoj7mifN and then tlk to me. Not top 10 smh
@dhwanisaraiya_ Tough one tbh, former MVP who’s had a recent resurgence, idk any NBA players like that
NBA always be on weird shit ..not giving the MVP a Christmas game?? I remember when they were giving the Knicks nationally televised games cuz Jeremy Lin had his moment
My predictions for The 2022 NBA Season and I got the Clippers and the Bucks in the 2022 NBA Finals And the Clippers winning the series in 7 games and Kawai Leonard winning the Finals MVP and DONT SAY I'M STUPID BECAUSE I'LL FUCKING GO CRAZY ON YOUR ASS BITCH
@AG_NBA_ @Captain589Price Tatum MVP and Celtics championship is def. in the realm of possibilities. Id place some bets on it
@amnrell @cairo_in_orbit @kingmos63322010 @Derrick_MSU_106 That’s cap. Malone is a 14x all star 2x MVP 5x All nba. Stockton is a 10-11 time all nba assist leader all star 5x all defensive steal leaders.  Bruh. They aren’t brought up in the goat convo, but they damn sure are among the best players in the league.

It’s interesting that in the NBA amount of games and being injury prone is absolutely a major factor in MVP race negating MVP winners (see #Embiid). But in the MLB  the fans &amp; voters almost completely discount Harper’s game count &amp; battle through his ailments v. Tatis. #Phillies
These guys are saying that missed games favors the player in the @MLB MVP race??? While the @NBA is all against missed games for MVP.
@tjgrace62 @senpaiseauxkun @jrsmithhenny @HilltopNBA 3x Allstar 3x All NBA and a MVP (more All Nba selections than cousins) In 6 seasons. While Cousins has 4x Allstar 2x All Nba in his 12 year career.

@GreenRolland @ya_hush @AMAZINIZDAVE @DwitjustinGilas @Ballislife of course he doesn't but he's a center that won the MVP award, Embiid also was in the race

The Dream was much more complete than both guys but centers still can win the hardware in today's NBA.
@MadddLionnn @newlyalex @JavonteVaeza You're the one who started the potential back2back champion narrative man <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>
If LJ was better than Luka today he should have been on top 6 of mvp candidates. The nba makes the decision not us, not your narratives <U+270C>
@MadddLionnn @newlyalex @JavonteVaeza That's your take bro. Your idol your choice. 
For me I'll go with NBA MVP results for sure. That's in the history books!
Facts and player performance, not someone else's opinion.
@Captain589Price Love to see it!!! I think possible Tatum MVP Season. Are you going become a Millionaire NO but maybe a ThousandAIRE.

@Phllee8194Lee @jrichardgoodman Malone bw ‘79-83, 3 MVP’s and a Chip. 4 1st team all nba teams.  He was dominant at his peak
one day you will be able to vote for the #NBA mvp by staking a moment as a vote

if the player you voted for wins, you will get priority access to an mvp pack with moments from that player’s mvp season
The most underrated player in #NBA history is Moses Malone, feels like a wide margin to me as he isn’t mentioned at all. Peak, MVP consistency, best offensive rebounder in league history and routinely dominated Kareem.
@futurenbatweets Jokic wins MVP, Scoring Champ, NBA CHAMP., FMVP in 2026
@MELOD1P fire!! Lamelo for MVP this season ! @NBAonTNT @NBA @ESPNNBA @JalenRose @stephenasmith https://t.co/OcJELyuHcr
Hall of Famer Dennis Johnson was born #OTD in 1954. Made 9 All-Defensive Teams, 5 All-Star Games &amp; was an NBA Finals MVP. Scored his most between 1980-82, averaging 19.1 PPG, before joining the Celtics. 10 years from 1979-88 averaged 15.8 PPG, 5.3 APG &amp; 4.1 RPG. https://t.co/TeuUPTD7AF
@mcuban Not bad for a 4x NBA All Star MVP
I forgot jokic won mvp the nba is so fried
Bold Prediction: The Brooklyn Nets will  go 16-0 in the 2021 NBA Playoffs.

After going 64-18 in the regular season, the Nets crush their opposition and sweep every round.

James Harden will win finals MVP.

It doesnt sit right with me that a majority white vote continues to gatekeep who our black legends are. Whether it be MVP, ALL NBA or #NBA75 

Kyrie, Iverson and TMac all better be on this list

@NBA @Jrue_Holiday11 @Giannis_An34 And the worst play too from CP3... Could've been a dangerous injury to the MVP..
@WhyNotBr0die I can dig it. Those are MVP numbers, again. Let’s hope that it ends with another All NBA season and a Finals win.

@OkayButNo5 @FadeawayWorld So two league MVP’s are on the team. Two multi winners of the scoring title. Kyrie has never even been All NBA first team. Let’s stop this .

The only MVP in NBA history that should unanimous is 2017. Everyone else has cases to be above the winner.
Pre Season Award Predictions:
MVP: Joel Embiid
Rookie of the year: Cade Cunningham
DPOY: Bam Adebayo
Most Improved Player: Michael Porter Jr
Coach of the year: Rick Carlisle
Executive of the year: Travis Schlenk

@nyknicks Best knick. Center ever better than Ewing people forget. NBA mvp 2 rings 2 finals MVPs more rebounds leading scorer on a team full of scorers. Ewing only claim is longevity. Reed was feared Ewing was respected. Great leader too.

@sambaer1960 @ProvideContext Agree.  Kareem was the GOAT of his generation.  3 NCAA Titles and 3 College Player of the Year, 6 NBA Championships, 6 NBA MVP’s, All time leading scorer…. Lebron is the GOAT of his generation.
@GCLLEYT @JahGoated How? Giannis already has more MVP’s than all 3 combined. 1 DPOY away from tying Kawhi. He’s obviously going to get more All NBA and All Defense teams as he is only 26.
@NBAMemes So, MVP candidates would have to play on bad teams. Then, gun their way to MVP on said teams that will never beat a complete with teams full of competent NBA players?
Giannis in 2020-21:

All-Star
All-Star Game MVP
All NBA First Team
First Team All Defense
NBA Champion
NBA Finals MVP

What a year. https://t.co/zveuWi0hJl

@imcuriousaboutt @SlimSleepr Curry fouling out for no reason in game 6
They were at least 3 if not 4 fouls that would not have been called on any MVP in NBA Finals history that would've been 4 more possesions for them in game 6 + Curry still playing in the 4th quarter

Let's say A certain NBA player like performs at a weak MVP level since his second year and continuously plays for very poor teams for like 11 years , has a serious injury and retires. How high would you rank him ?
Jokic is so skilled. He should be getting more hype from the NBA lmao. MVP with zero hype smh
New NEKO is up-No.92

Dennis Johnson was born on this day in 1954.

During his retirement ceremony, Magic Johnson lauded him as "the best backcourt defender of all-time".

Larry Bird called Johnson the best teammate he ever had.

1979 NBA Finals MVP.

3x NBA Champion.

No. 3 retired by Celtics.
