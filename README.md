This is also the order in which these projects were completed chronologically, and thus show a progression in my skills over time. 
The repo itself is only meant to contain the code and associated outputs for the respective projects, and does not repeat information presented in the website, only how that information was generated. Any questions or comments can be addressed by emailing me at <a href='mailto:js4666@georgetown.edu'>js4666@georgetown.edu</a>.
