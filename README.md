# Projects

This directory is home to all code created by Jake Steinfink in the process of completing multiple projects, most of which are featured on <a href= "jrs.georgetown.domains"> my website</a> including:

1. NBA Salary Prediction
2. Spotify Genre Analysis - Group Project
3. Data Science Toolkit
4. NFL Onside Kick Proposal
5. GIS - Heat & Health
6. Big Data project Using Reddit Data - Group Project
7. Tik Tok Popularity Analysis - Group Project

This is also the order in which these projects were completed chronologically, and thus show a progression in my skills over time. 
The repo itself is only meant to contain the code and some of the finalized outputs for the respective projects. Information from the website itself
will not be repeated but any outputs in standalone documents will be present. Any questions or comments can be addressed by emailing me at <a href='mailto:js4666@georgetown.edu'>js4666@georgetown.edu</a>.
